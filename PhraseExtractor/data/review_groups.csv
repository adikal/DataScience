0,I like this smaller version which fits nicely on my nightstand and is handy without taking up much room..Fun apps for kids.Nice for music in the bedrooms..Alexa is pretty dumb but the package overall is good..My phone sounds better.My google home mini dominates on sound quality and much more..Love it.Good little thing wish speaker was a little louder.Setup was easy.Its ok.Nothing special.Google App has FAR more info than Echo.and I think they're great.We love it.works as listed.A very versatile gizmo for the price.I now have more which I couldn't live without asking to playing music check the weather simple math sports and stock news.While this particular item may have plenty of flaws Amazon has clearly created something that everyone must possess.This is just the first generation of devices.so I'm expecting incredible improvements in the technology and massive integration of this type of artificial intelligence throughout our homes in our cars and around the world.It's probably something you should be aware of and begin understanding how to interact with as ai will become a big part of our lives soon..Great product just wish the speaker was a little louder.Other than that it s awesome and look forward to getting more.I heart radio direct instead of my Pandora ...Otherwise ok.It does what my echo does without the nice speaker.I greatly prefer my Echo Show over my Echo Dot..We have fun asking it all sorts of things.We love the music the games the stories the jokes the calling feature the audio books the fact checking..I got my Alexa when I bought a pack of LIFX wireless smart bulbs.I also bought a pack of Teckin smart plugs.I live in a dorm room.it works great Easy to set up and easy to use.We love our Echo Dots.Easy to operate.We love it.I love it.It's great.Just starting to synchronize new Alexa products with it.So far it has meet my expectations..it is not work never play one song complete I still need to play music from my Mac..Very tinny speakers Bought the pack so they were only each.Of the three one gets very warm compared to the other.These are extras for additional rooms maybe should have waited for a good markdown sale on the Echo.I have the original echo and a dot.The original works great but the dot doesn't work consistently maybe.Perhaps the wireless receiver isn't strong enough...Still no long term improvement..Alexa is great.So easy to use.We don't use it as much as we thought we would.We have Google home in our house and we use that much more than Alexa.Disconnects frequently.Isn t as loud as the the original echo..Cool little device.Answer all my questions great alarm clock and a lot more.and I can say Alexa turn on bedroom light.Have a few more on order.I have also ordered a few Smart Light Switches.I bought one and I loved it .......so I bought more one for every room.Outstanding does everything it claims to do works perfectly no complaints happy.I love Alexa.So easy to set up and use.Besides easily checking the weather or a word definition you can set specific reminders and also access your electronic phone calendars.Thanks for the smile Alexa Laying in bed at night can t fall asleep.I have since bought one more for myself and two more for my friends..Love it.And all works great with Echo Dot.My kids love it play with Alexa...Great for just about everything.Pretty cool technology.Voice recognition not always great though as Alexa does misinterpret my voice at times.All in all still worth the price especially once I add other smart devices to my home..I purchased my first Dot as a Christmas gift to myself and love it so much.I like this product very much and have found that it is much more functional than Google Home.In our case it was a Kasa Smart Wi Fi Plug by TP Link.That product worked fairly well for approximately three months and then stopped abruptly.so I cannot voice my displeasure with that product directly..we fell in love with it and decided to buy one for the kids to be able to set their own alarms and listen to their own music.What fun.Although the process looks simple I had to run through it more than several times before it actually set up.I'm not into popular culture so most of the questions are useless for me.It skips music and pauses frequently.Works well easy set up wish it was a little louder.Works very good but occasionally Alexa doesn't hear my commands and does something else.Not as loud as I thought it would be but its pretty nice..I thought it would have more volume to it.Love Alexa.Great for the value.So far.....Great when you need to verify that your grandkids Math problems are correct..Nice convenient to have when listening to music or need information..I love my echo dot.Works great.I love this product for listening to my music.Also it s great for appointment reminders.But overall I am happy with my echo dot..I love it.This little gadget is my favorite thing in my home.it's absolutely thee most helpful piece of technology anyone can have plugged in at home.If u want to hear your favorite song just ask Alexa.If u want your lights turned on or off hands free just ask Alexa.Oh did I mention she tells jokes too AMAZon AMAZing..Have it linked to my Amazon Music Unlimited account and can play my dad s playlist or favorite artists anytime he needs it.I love the game skills the corny jokes of the day and that it can access my favorite religious website and read the Bible or play music located there..Great product very useful.It s important that I keep track of my many activities during the day as a single mother who is working full time so being able to say Alexa set a reminder is wonderful.I love listening to amazon music.Loved it very handy for reminders and fun to use in general.Works as described Great for travelling Nice and compact.Great gift item..I bought this dot for my kitchen easy recipe questions great kitchen dance jams at a good volume and easy to access.will be buying more for other rooms in the house..I love Alexa.I ask it to play music give our local weather ask the time and many other things..So far thing has just become one more thing for the kids to fight over.I love it.Absolutely love this.My husband and I have used it more to play sleep sounds at night.Wish the sound quality was a bit better otherwise a great device.Love these.So glad I bought ...great for streaming your favorite music kids love asking alexa questions..It was a gift and it works great.Sometimes I have to repeat a few things but part of that is getting more familiar with the Dot..Love it.I like being able to say Echo start my day.That s a great function and it s handsfree.I do enjoy the reminders and alarms that i am able to set for my kids though that is a great feature..I love my Echo Dot.I initially bought this for my kids to help with school really things like spelling and research.However we use it for so much more music alarms timers recipes pretty much everything.I'm very impressed by all the things echo can do.Got it as a gift its a nice little product connected to my home theater.Worked good.I love this DOT.Very easy to set up.In feature is really great.I love it....Very good.Our family loves it this was a great gift..It was easy to connect and pair with my Echo.Its exactly what I expected..easy to hook up..We are enjoying this so far.The kids are enjoying Alexa.I bought this for the sole purpose of being able to say Alexa play whatever song it failed completely to play the song I wanted to play via my Pandora account it kept telling me it could play it via a Amazon Music account.If I run out of something I can immediately add it to my shopping list with a quick command.I can also quickly figure out what type of coat I should run out of the house with in the morning when I haven't had my coffee yet.The only thing holding Alexa back is that it uses the Bing search engine and will not be able to answer everything.I really wish you can swap it to Google you probably can somehow like with a skill but am not currently aware.The voice reception also isn't the greatest thing ever invented but it is good enough.I need to raise my voice with a somewhat loud AC running which I think is fair and shouldn't be a major gripe.A normal person in the room probably wouldn't be able to hear me mumbling something with the AC running either.This thing is so cheap for what it does.I love this echo dot.I really like it that hubby can ask how to spell something.We love Alexa and won't stop until we have one in every room of the house.Very handy I use it to control Bluetooth light bulbs and plugs.It is also great for streaming music and answering questions.so far works great.I like the quick hands free ability to get information without having to wait..So fun...Sound isn't very good.The convenience of having information easily available..The Dot device works fine.The knowledge of Alexa is not the best.Way too many.It would be nice to have the answer expanded upon and more information on the subject given.Also it would be better for to continue questioning on the current topic to get a clearer answer.Instead it is necessary to change the way you ask questions to get the answer you were trying to get to in the first palce.Works great as a timer for trivia type questions the weather and to play songs but other than that.The sound is great and it seems to understand very well when asked a questions.I never thought I wanted or needed on but got it as a package deal with something else I purchased which made this really cheap and couldn't resist what all the fuss was about.Since I have had it my kids have loved asking questions and jokes.My husbands loves that he can get the weather when getting ready for work without have to turn on the TV or scrolling his phone.I also like that I can be busy and tell it to call someone from my contact and it does.All out I would have to say I'm glad I made the decision to purchase this.They've discovered story time and opening the magic door as well.they really like em..Works great...Love my dot Alexa has lots of skills that she can learn with a simple click on her appor Amazon site.We love to play games with her.and I love to Bluetooth my book through my dot as a work in the house.Love it.Lol Love that you can use your Echo as an intercom.Very handy throughout the house.It is right there..The Echo Dot is so impressive that our family will purchase other Alexa based electronics..But it is so much more... music alarm.How did I live without it.I love the echo products and got this for use of the upstairs room.The speaker is pretty weak but overall a good addition.Like how easy it is to set up multiple echo devices.Also like that with the app on my android I can connect to them easily..Best device ever for under dollars.Cloud technology improves and Alexa gets better with time.This is a great device but if you are getting it because your concerned that a bigger device won't cover a big enough area you may want to use the bigger one for a while first..Great for needed reminders.Good stuff.The dot is awesome.I love echo..I love this echo.It s great to listen to music with..My wife and son love the music that it plays and the joke it tells..Complete waste.My husband bought this and we really don't need it..I also enjoy the skills that facillitate saying the rosary while I work in the kitchen.Also it is a little sad that I have now increased my use of technology...when one may be better off enjoying the silence that leads to greater peace and true joy..Live being to ask Alexa for specific songs.works great.I have the echo and that is very good.Good product however the Volume does not go very high..lol funny.it understands him completely and actually communicates on first command.but it's a good device.but i supposed in my unexpected anticipation i never rechecked my order.but it's all good.lol thanks to the people who have been blessed in the field of future technology..Easy to setup and use.Very responsive.Completely satisfied..Works great.and they love it.Love everything about my Echo dot.At this point I use it mainly for music weather time and clock.Very pleased with it no issues.Easy to set up..Love my echo for setting alarms.My own personal DJ.Lol.I purchased the device while it was on Christmas promotion to work with several home automation devices smart switch that I have in house.The to be loved part are the installation is easy fun to play with and worked as promised.I felt the technician might have a believe how great the product should be and how could I had such issues to be questioned.In short.. issues still exist and Echo Dot does not seem to be fixed nor allow to reset.I got the Echo Dot bundles with the Amazon Firestick for an amazing deal during Prime Day.I mainly used the Echo Dot to set an alarm for the following morning or have her tell me what the weather is like.You ll have some fun interactions with it.I m working one smartifying my home so will be looking to purchase a few more in the future.Possibly an Echo or Echo Plus for better speakers..I enjoyed the white Echo Dot.Brings out the vibrant colors as well.Good.With Echo it functions well as an alarm clock weather report some research and information and as a wonderful distraction for grandchildren..I love having the dot in my bathroom makes it so easy to check traffic weather news or just listen to my favorite music.Fun.She doesn t comprehend very well.Isn t loud either..It doesn t do as much as I thought it would be able to do.Intuitive intelligent responses.Could use a better speaker.Overall worth the bucks.On occasion... rare occasion great jokes.Just love these Echo Dots.I love everything about Alexa but y all need to work with google because I have the show in kitchen and Alexa is pointless.Yes echos are a great addition to our home..Great item.It works great everytime.she answers though lol.Pro very fun and entertaining.Con can hear very well at times other times have to repeat yourself Hint.I have her turn on my coffee pot with my Wemo smart plug.I purchased works great when waking up.Works great.At first I was just asking for weather and playing the radio.This is such a great device to have..Absolutely a great product Really helps me do thing and remembers what you ve said Sinks with tv easily.I love it.Super great product.Great functionality..Just like the larger echo Alexa works great.Very happy with my Echo Dot.I liked it so much i ordered the Dot for another room.The Dot exceeded my expectations for the sound..It connects to my phone hotspot when I go through the entire setup process and works fine.I called Amazon and they said the solution is to go through the setup process every time and it will work fine.I might as well plan to get in my car minutes early every time.Love that I can tell her what to do.My only suggestion would be that it could use a better speaker..Love it..So far it does everything I have asked really like the drop in feature..Then my aunt uncle bought one and loved it.Both are yrs old.How easy it is to use.Voice recognition almost flawless.I don't use it much...Connected easily to my big Bluetooth speaker and the music quality is better than the small echo.Alexa is a great randomizer for casual music.Sometimes I don't know exactly what I want to hear...Alexa does a good job of playing random selections for a particular style that are interesting.Maybe it will become more useful in the future...the music alone is worth the cost..I have an existing sound bar and want an echo extension in my room.Echo dot works perfectly after integrating it with my existing sound bar.It's amazing and with smart compatible power switches now alexa is like a house helper to switch of the lights and tell us about the weather.Will buy more for other room whenver the amazon deal come again.Best product best price.Good.I love it.but I wish it had more music I like that I don t have to pay extra for..It works great and also allows them to have Alexa check things for them.Happy with product.Both my brother and son liked to receive as a gift..set up was not as ez to setup compared to them setup as The Echo nd gen.Now it s fine after quite sometime spent..Easy to use.Fun to play with.Everything in General.Love it.Worth spending the extra to get the bigger one..Wish I had more for yhe house..Its wonderful.We are still learning basic usage we aren't tech savvy.love it have been using it for music and my audible books the most but fun to use with other things to.Enjoy listening to music while working on my laptop.With Alexa I don't run my battery on my android playing music that is downloaded on my device..and super fun.Love this Echo Dot.Easy set up.Connected to my WiFi easily.and she answers me right away.I now meditate before I go to sleep and wake up to the sound of music.I really enjoyed having the echo..Love having Alexa work for me...once the set up was complete it s enjoyable.Alexa works better than Siri.Better comprehension and better able to find answers online.I love how it pairs to my Audible and Amazon music accounts..So far working great no issues with connecting or contacting.Very happy with this purchase..I loved.Fun fun fun.Really love Alexa.love it always.I love waking up to Alexa in the monrng and having her read my morning devotional plus play music while I relax at home..It's easy to set up and use the design is sleek and my quality of life is improved.Got a new phone and still couldn't get it to sync.I use my Echo Dot Alexa on a daily basis and for simple tasks it she works wonderfully.Requests and questions such as start a minute timer read news from NPR and what is divided by all work work just fine.The Echo Dot has amazing reviews.but I honestly believe that it is because this is a new technology and people are enamored with its novelty.We bought this on a great sale and it was so worth it.Turns our lamp on and off an easy timer reminder stores my grocery list and more..I have an original full size.Tell it to turn off the basement lights it'll either say there is no device called lights or OK which it then turns off the bedroom lights.Great product.but if you want loud music just go for the full size echo.The sound is too weak for the shower.Keeping this dot but buying another full size echo.Alexa's humor isn't the greatest and the weather source is far from correct.Otherwise great source for music inquiries and information.Love the bluetooth option.Very helpful piece of tech.I thought I would enjoy this a little more.Got it mostly for playing music.The Dot works great very happy with it.I can't return it so I unplugged and boxed it..works good.I love my echo dot..I love the Dot and Alexa works really well gives answers the first time although it does have it's limitations.but I have found it to be much better than Siri.As a prime member I get free music.I liked Amazons music capabilities so much that I bought an Sonos One with Alexa..I ve got two other echo s and love them.The sound quality is way lower then the larger model.It cost a bit more but the sound is allot better..Works really well.I wish it were a little more understanding though..Moreover the volume was low the speakers had a lot static.but now everyone should know this are great devices.I have the regular echo in my kitchen and love it.I wasn't certain when I ordered the Echo Dot that it would work as well as the Echo.but I was very pleasantly surprised.Music quality was not the same as the large echo but you can attach to larger speakers if you want..I love these so much that I give them to my rental clients..It's cool and with my prime it's even better.Speaker quality at louder volume settings isn t great at all.However very compact and just as useful as the larger models..It's very useful but wish she could do more things.but it's really cool.Love it.New to smart technology for the home.Works great for an alarm.I absolutely love my echo dot.Being able to operate my music play games listen to stories send messages and even make calls using my voice is something I have dreamed of doing since I was a kid in the's.People are so quick to play the BIG BROTHER IS LISTENING card and not appreciate the little conveniences of technology.Let big brother listen I have nothing to hide and I definitely enjoy this little gizmo.Plus I gave her a British accent making it a more enjoyable AI dialogue for me.HIGHLY recommend if you like this type of technology..Good product.The echo dot as small compact and pretty neat the amazon alexa voice assistant integrates really well with your home smart appliances and instantly converts your home to a smart home.I admit alexa needs to be worked on a bit to be an even more amazing product but for the price you can't complain..I loved my first gen Echo.and I love my Echo dot even more.Good extension to my Echo.We love Alexa and we got a great price.There has been a skill for all of the smart devices in my home.Plus there are a never ending list of fun and informative skills available as well.In the time i have been using the dot i have seen improvements like using a different wake word and being able to stack commands.The only thing that would be nice is if the web app was more like the mobile app in being able to customize or disable smart home devices..Amazing.It was okay.it's full potential with a spot..Where where it is placed it is a good spot because my phone is not loud enough play music over the running bath water.Exactly as advertised set up was simple and it was exactly what i wanted..My own purchase love it use it everyday.The best thing ever happened to me.It would be nice if it had a battery for portability like going to the park or lake.Besides I've loved using it..I purchased this echo to expand my smart house in a part of the house where Alexa cannot he hear.so no other obstacles around it and it almost never hears my commands.It s pretty used.Fire tv cube however does very well in my Living room.Bought this on Prime Day to see if such an item might be useful.It was easy to add to my Amazon Kindle and Fire family and was working in less than half an hour.I started by asking a bunch of questions with obscure answers and was pleasingly surprised at the number Alexa answered correctly.I plan on using it to make up and transmit my Whole Foods orders..I love my dot.Addicting Extremely happy.While on special I now have three in my home and love them.Device worked fine for the first months.It's also not as loud as I would have liked.I guess that's why they keep coming out with new versions because this ain't it.Love it so far.the reminder option is GOLD.We love our Amazon.echo dose so many things u can ask her so many questions and she has answer for about everything you will need to download the alexa app but very easy to hook up.I got mine hooked up to my sound bar which is cool to hook up your Bluetooth device u will need to go your alexa app and add device.Also have my Wi Fi Light bulb hooked up with it which is awesome.This has been fun.I thought it would have done more.Love it got it at a great Price.I absolutely love my Alexa.I thought I wouldn't enjoy it since I hardly ever use Siri but Alexa is great.Now my mom wants one for her home and my friends expect one for chirstmas haha.Having it setup to my fire stick has been great.By far my best purchase and it was a gift for my husband that he loves as well.Didn't really see the value of Alexa and the overall system but now that it is installed and working flawlessly I would never give it up.Whether a quick forecast question addition to a shopping list or wake up call the service works great and is an incredible convenience..Fun Nothing to add..nice.and he loves it Very useful..I really like asking questions hearing my daily updates and listening to books.I felt that I needed to acquaint myself with the device before submitting an accurate review but the problems are worrisome and I doubt that they will be addressed until hopefully the generation model is available.The first problem I have is that the device demands a very accurate speech pattern before you can get what you are seeking.A battery back up would be nice when you want to listen to music and don't have an outlet handy.The positive aspects of the device are the ease of handling.I like listening to the news and getting exactly what I want to listen to without wading through everything else.The sleep sounds are very nice.The support techs are great and always there when I have a problem.They are always patient and supportive and I am always satisfied with their service.Great companion to our main unit.Very user friendly.Wonder why this has a day warranty when all other Echo products have a full year.Even more this echo dot HAS to be plugged in to work which is a waste of time and energy.It's cool for setting and sticking to any agenda while being hands free.Alexa on echo dot does wonders in managing our smart home home security.moreover if one is alone Alexa keeps you good company..Bought this for home setup was a breeze took it with me on vacation reconfigure to new location also a breeze.I really enjoy listening to my morning brief while getting ready to start my day.I honestly thought I d never get one of these and now that I have I can t imagine life without it.The Echo dot is great for my nightstand.and I am able to play my music set alarms and ask questions.It s an amazing piece of technology.I love everything about it..We truly enjoy the Echo.Great product would buy again just wish the speaker was a little louder.Love my Echo Dot.Lucked out both times and got them first.Highly recommend.REALLY.SURE I WILL LOVE IT.When.we first set this item up as per the instructions It seemed fine at first.I would like to thank you in advance for lisitening Love Amazon.Very happy with..ok.This is my first hands free Echo Dot.I love both of these devices for different uses.The Amazon Tap has a fantastic speaker and is portable.We have used it outside for great sounding music.The only disadvantage with the Tap is that it is not hands free.The Echo Dot is hands free and I love that but the speaker is not that powerful to hear music like the Tap.The Echo Dot is a hands free wonderful effortless source of on the dot source of information.I would highly recommend both of these devices for a full range of uses..Easy setup.I love Alexa.Good value for the money..Echo dot has a great sound quality..I love Alexia.This is awesome.I figured though uncle sam is already listening to everything you say from every laptop every ipad every tablet every phone and most TV's now in addition to voice activated remotes..Love it.Dot is now in two bedrooms and is a great alarm weather news and entertainment device.We have added telephone ability for any unexpected emergencies.The main Echo unit is in our living room and helps us do a number of things including playing movies.Wonderful.Usually I don't have to repeat myself more than times and if it does take me that many times I give up because whatever I want isn't that important.I should have known better.Like I said I usually don't have to repeat myself more than x.I was repeating Alexa Stop increasing my volume until actually shouting then lowering my voice to see if that would make her listen then raising it again out of frustration and just to see if she's FREAKING DEAF rinse repeat for a solid minutes until I remembered there are buttons on the top of the device.If I had been more awake I would have unplugged it or pressed the button sooner instead of shouting forever.Also she is not too far away from me or obstructed in any way.When she works she works fine.I have tolerated it up to this point because I don't really use it.and I don't care that much.or it is worth it to other people.Alexa is informative amusing and surprisingly addictive.However music that was available when we first started now requires Amazon music subscription or we have to listen to entire album to hear Sarah Vaughn s Close to you.I absolutely love this product.So easy to use and set up.Love the price I paid for it.I love it.We bought the Echo Dot along with a docking station with an alarm clock with battery backup a few days after we bought our Exho Show for the kitchen amazing if you like to cook recipes measurements and conversions timer entertainment.We love both.However so far we are impressed..Good for playing music but Alexa lacks skills of google home as content is restricted to only amazons network can t play African songs or ask generic questions and get the right answers.I love this for my daughter.I wish that each echo could be in more than one multi room music group though..I mainly use this as a bluetooth speaker which it does very well.Three time I was chatting with Technical Support everything wet great until we got the Connect with WiFi.As you have to verbally respond in older to turn it off..love.I love Alexa.Exactly what I wanted.Awesome.Originally I purchased only one of these.After playing around with it for about a week I went back and purchased two more.I love these things.I primarily use these to play music from my Amazon Prime Unlimited and various other accounts.I also use it for weather reports commute times to send messages to family and friends to order things off of Amazon to wake me up in the morning and just as a source for general trivia.it gives me a news briefing every morning while I'm getting ready for work.I m going to start purchasing the smart home devices light switches wall plugs and a thermostat and see how they work with Alexa soon.I love that once I have those installed I can simply walk into my bedroom and say Alexa goodnight and my lights around the house will all turn off the front and back doors will lock the ceiling fan above my bed will come on and my music will begin to play over the blue tooth speakers at a soft volume thus allowing me to drift off to sleep.Then when it s time to get up Alexa lets me know by blasting Reveille from my speakers starts my coffee maker turns on the bedroom light turns off the ceiling fan and gives me my morning news briefing.Great for listening to music via voice command.I have it hooked up through my stereo system and the sound quality is excellent it struggles to hear my commands when the music is on loud but otherwise does fantastic.This item was exactly what I thought it would be....It's amazing.If it weren't for the grand kids I'd have to send it back..The Echo Dot is fine for listening to quiet music in my kitchen.Personally I loved the Tap which was wireless and had full rich sound which for reasons I don t understand has been discontinued.I d gladly buy one if production of them were to resume.For the price it s ok..It works great and I would love to use it more.Absolutely love this thing Try cussing at it lol.My nephew keeps using it so i cant.. lol.Absolutely love our Dot's we have in the house.We use them mainly for music weather and shopping lists..I have and love it.Alexa is awesome.Love how chic the white looks.Will be purchasing more white ones in the future.It has all the functionality of an Echo Tap whatever but the speaker quality is not very high and the volume also doesn't go very high.These are amazing.I ended up getting of them and put them throughout the house Not only is it excellent as an intercom I can drop in to the dot in the house even when away from home using the app It does tons of other amazing things too.and I am impressed.Love.Its cool.It s nice but the sound quality isn t that great it s close to my phones speaker.I would think it would have more for its size but.the Alexa aspects great.Love love love it.I think the nag my kids feature is great.Just means I need more.The ability to make reminders play music and the dropbin feature are amazing.Thought it would do more..It never worked right and no one at Amazon knew how to fix.Very nifty.Only downside will not play deferent music from echo in other room.tells me it is connected go to the alexa ap to finish and then it says to connect to wi fi over and ovar.its a fun gaget.You need to use a separate cell phone to make the connection to the Hot Spot initially.I love the way that I can ask questions and also listen to music as I fall asleep the best.best thing since short wave radio.It s an entertaining toy that can easily be addictive.It s simple to set up and very user friendly.Best thing I have ever bought in my life.I love it.Awesome A most for kids dorms or your first one.but the sound doesn't reach everywhere in my apartment.I also linked it to a smart plug for the lights.It was easy to install the sound is fine it works great.It s fine sound quality sucks there is no bass..This was supposed to be on special for.Works well and is a great value..I ordered these for my family because I own one.and I just love it.Not hard to set up and more handy than I expected.I like being able to listen to music with one command..I waited for a while before buying an echo because of not being sure on how they work or how to hook it up.and I love it.Better than google home mini..I haven't had a lot of time to play around with it but so far its been fun.My granddaughters have fun asking it questions and it even tells stories pretty cool.The volume isn't loud like echo..I love it.Love that it s small and can be used as your alarm..Works great..we all love it good product very smart very cute.but I was surprised that I actually found some uses for it.Easy setup..Alexa is awesome.And she does nt talk back Lol.Great and Alexa keeps me company all day.The sound is clear but a bit tinney.It works great.We use our dots for everything we love them..crazy too much fun.What can I say we love Her.Works great.Love the echo dot.Very helpful device from instant math equations.baking recipes sports news amazon reorders neat device to have and the best part at a price point.Really nice paired to a Bluetooth speaker.IMPORTANT PANDORA ADVICE if you say Alexa play Pandora.BUT if you want to play your chosen'Shuffle' selections you MUST ask exactly this way Alexa ask Pandora to play my shuffle station.You're welcome.Super fun.We absolutely love our echo and find it extremely useful for weather and asking questions.I have woken up many times during the night and because I can't see the alarm clock.Now I just ask Alexa what time it is Love the many features that my Echo does.Easy way to have alexa always at the ready to serve..Very good product to use.We liked it..Works beautifully complements my Echo Echo Show nicely..she will love it.Great product.i m a bit disappointed.i have been looking for a bluetooth speaker and I was really looking forward when purchasing the amazon echo dot and when i received it I was playing music and the volume.wasn t the greatest i wished it could go higher and volume.I love the alexa and everything about it but the volume on the echo dot didn t satisfy my expectations.I think that now so many people are looking for a bluetooth speaker that has an option of a higher volume and this isn t a good option..When I am ready for bed I have it play sounds of the forest surf a brook etc for minutes.how but it was finally connected I have been enjoying since..I love it.She moved into assisted living and could not get her radio to work due to the steel construction of the building.and she had for years tuned our local

Alexa about all kinds of topics I really enjoy music.Have paired the Dot with a Bluetooth portable speaker great combination..Very neat product.Better than expected.The dot is nice to have around the office to keep me organized.It has many cool features that you can teach I would recommend this product.Amazon has something new to add the Echo every week.Very satisfied..Great.Perfect.Functional but not loud enough even on high ...best for all non music applications.Just perfect for my bedroom.I can't seem to get it working right.I think it pilot error me lol.Best gift for my preteen.It was easy

dot.Easy set up.Fun for the grandkids.Great as a kitchen timer..Works great sound is better than expected..got this because i want sure how much i would like alexa in my house.fell in love with the dot and want the bigger alexa because the sound is ok with the dot just a little hard to hear when youre working on things.It's really v good.Very easy to use.I highly recommend it.But device is pretty convenient for lazy moments and the kids enjoy asking her to play they're fave songs..it has trouble understanding me at times.The Echo is just amazing....my wife....made my home controllable with my voice...just amazing.It s smal enough so it doesn t take up space and sounds great..The Dot is fine.Amazon wants you to pay for each device.I find that really greedy of them considering how much I pay for my original echo plus my prime.I have limits on how far I can be exploited ..I like the items I ve purchased to add like light switches and plugs.Speakers are better for listening to music.I have or dots love the convenience and put them to use everyday..Working late hours and scheduling next day activities has never been easy.Echo DOT is awesome.My samsung phone sounds better.Woks great Love it.The sound quality isn't spectacular but adequate for compact speaker..You really don't need more than this for Alexa unless you want to video conference.Perfect little gadget..Works great even without a hub...this thing is so fun..its going to come in handy for my wife battling Brain cancer.she can now talk to Alexa and to turn on off the lights..Great price.now still won t play the free music for prime members but continuously suggests we sign up for the pricey subscription to Amazon Unlimited Music.Does nothing I find remotely useful without having to purchase more gizmos or download install more apps.Got an expensive nice looking hockey puck tho..Very efficient for the price.So many more uses than I realized.I love this little contraption.I bought planning to give one as a gift but ended up keeping it for my bedroom and bought more as gifts Run don t walk your finger to Alexa immediately.She s so helpful and fun.Simple to set up and found it to be economical during Amazon Days.The only thing we would like to see is more written explanation with the product..It works great Easy setup.So convenient Love having it.Fits perfect in the bathroom..I m very happy with the my order I use it to listen to music shop and ask what the weather is.Very convenient and useful.but my year old grandson is really great.but he doesn't live with me..A perfect addition to our Echo family.I plugged my bedroon Dot into an old set of desktop speakers for richer sound.We will be adding more soon..Exactly how I expected.This is great for my condo.No wiring easy to move around and sound is great.Just wish they could be a little louder when at top volume..Great little size and ease of use.Made perfect gifts for the family.I can set a timer with my watch or my phone or even an old fashioned twist timer I don't need this electronic device to do it for me.I used to be able to set a reminder that would go every days to remind me to change my air conditioning filter.With each and every update they do the device is more and more useless if that's even possible.Compact and easy to connect..Wife and I love the device...Fantastic..It s a fun thing to have in the home.We like Alexa so much that we now have one in each area of the house.Our boys love having her in their rooms to tell nighttime stories play songs or answer questions.Alexa is a good girl..So far we have really enjoyed using Alexa to set alarms share fun facts give us reminders set timers add to the shopping list read the kids short stories and play music.The echo dot has been a fun addition to our home..This product has MANY outstanding features and gains more every day.It will be interesting to see where this technology goes..It is fun to use..Works great.Alexa is good with what it does but some of the skills are disabled if you are not in that country.I bought one of these for my kitchen but even at full blast its not much louder than playing music on your phone in your pocket..Love my Echo Dot.It s awesome to play music and talk to friends.I love it for the most part.Good product Very responsive.Needs to be turned louder than the Echo for good listening.But overall excellent value for the money..I found the dots easy to set up and use.It was really interesting when I asked my kindle to bring up my books the dot said I should check out prime books and the Echo started reading the book I was part way through.The dots have been separated from both each other and the main Echo and work great.It is definitely nice to have Alexa around the house although I don't have a smart house for updates music and someone who actually answers me.The only limitation I have found thus far is the dots even with external speakers attached don't increase volume very much.The dot twins were easy to manage.so I'm sure it won't be long until we increase the size of the Echo family once again..Very easy to set up love that I can pair with echo show.Surprised how clear the speaker is..I didn't have a lot of need for one but wound up with a free one and ended up using it for weather alarms and voice control for my bedroom light.but it's definitely not a must have in my honest opinion..and I wish I had more info before I purchased it.Love it.I listen to many things now.Only good thing is news and streaming music.Have yet to be able to download the app on my phone so that I can make calls.Excellent product.I was first introduced to this product at my children's home.That was so cool.I purchased one for myself and now have it in my kitchen where I can have a handy timer get whatever music I want to listen to and best of all.I can get the correct spelling of words I LOVE this product..Love the idea of having an Echo dot small enough to put in any room.Continually wants to charge me an additional.Discouraging............trying to find a way NOT to have to pay more to listen to music in another location in my home..I love Alexa.so.I loved my echo dot until it died.There was no way to repair it according to customer service so now my only option is to buy a new one.That really ticks me off since it isn t even a year old.It s a rip off to have to pay for a second one at a price higher than I paid for the first one for it to only work eight months.That really ticks me off.Anyway take it for what it s worth.I have been very pleased with the Echo Dot especially with the speakers.It can actually be heard throughout the house..very handy.Just got the dot and so far LOVE it.we love this in our house.mostly used for music.I enjoy it and it works perfect..Great product.It does not answer many of my questions.Much smaller than the original product it still does all of the things that I want it to.Very happy with the product.It s easy to use for my year old.Can t answer most relevant questions and AI is not I yet.Hard to describe how much fun I have with Alexa.I discover something new everyday and when you're a senior living in a rest home that's a good thing.It is so great to be living at a time when device is like this are available..Love to have instant music of any variety nonstop.Grandchildren enjoy corny jokes.Nice to tell time temperature ages dates of events...ingenious little booger.I have enjoyed having it and think it works pretty well..My family and I mainly use ours as an intercom system.Hangs up too fast.Amazing how versatile and useful this thing is.I plan to buy a couple more for other rooms in my home..This device really is pretty amazing.I know that my family has only touched the tip of the iceberg but so far my girls love to ask Alexa to play their favorite songs at will and start spontaneous living room dance parties my wife and I enjoy playing Jeopardy and realizing we aren't as smart as we think we are and it has been a really convenient timer for when your hands are full.I'm excited to learn many more uses over the coming months and years.excellent product works great with my Alexa.amazing.I'm years old.I've seen a lot of things developed over my life time.It sounds as good as a full sized unit.Cool and convenient.My calendar and most of my apps are handy at voice command from across the room.And Since Alexa Bluetooths into my audiobook library and the huge Amazon music library I have endless entertainment.There is much more to say for for a small voice recognition device....Easy to install.Purchased this dot mainly for music in another portion of the house.Didn t expect much but certainly disappoints even a reasonable expectation.Music alarm news general information.They are now an indispensable part of our lives..Easy to set up works great.It was a gift so just having fun with it so far.I've used it for alerts some as a list maker and playing great oldies..Easy setup and installation..Perfect for bedroom sounds.Its great if you are in a little place.cool device.Recieved in perfect condition.My son is thrilled to have his own Dot.He called everyone on the contacts list enabled close to a million skills set his own alarm to wake up tomorrow and is now if in bed ON TIME sleeping to ocean sounds....I certainly like Alexa s voice recognition capabilities in addition to seamless syncs with calendar.Loved it....My girls are ten six and three years old all of them liked it too.Love It.I loved this Echo Dot.So easy to use and is so small and compact..Got one as a gift love it.Easy set up and has worked great vs. competition..and I'm totally satisfied.It has become an important part of my Smart Home.Brilliant....Nice.The speakers arnt loud enough ansh.Does so much with my echo plus and tons of stuff in my house..I really don't know what to do with it other then play music.lol.I use it to listen to music and it works fine..Turns the coffe on great.It is a lot of fun for my granddaughter We could play all kids songs Love it.Love Alexa my kids like playing Questions.Great product..Works great..I Feel like the speaker could be louder and bettter quality but overall good for the price.Very handy when you need a quick answer..Living room light TV and bedroom light.It's Great.These little devices are just awesome.Works exactly like my other ones..My kids love it and asked Alexa hundreds of questions every day.satisfied so far.Every day it is something new.Best tech product out there.Great alarm setup.Amazon music is the best.Great speakers for apt living..Love it.Easy to use.Somewhat difficult to set up for those not technically inclined but very easy to use..I love this product.Easy to use keeps track of lists plays music and even tells jokes.What's not to love..I also like it for the latest news stories.Love it in the bedroom.it is cheap and do not buy it.We're really enjoying our Dot.I'm finding new ways to integrate with our daily life..I love this.Works well in loud rooms.Simply pulling the plug and reconnecting fixes the problem for a few hours but who wants to do that every single day Good concept but unreliable low quality product..The echo dot is super helpful.It s like a smart alarm clock that keeps me informed at the same time.We love Alexa.We were sceptical but it was such a great price that we decided to try it and we are delighted..great gift idea worked perfectly.Easy to use.Works great does all its suppose to.But so far I like it..We love to play games love the option to set timers and play music..It s Great.What an amazing device So much fun exploring the various functions and uses.I love putting reminders on my kids dots with my phone app.We also have Alexa tell them their parents are proud of them at bedtime.Fantastic.Incredible.I went to add more Dots to my house to finally give us full house multiroom music.I finally changed phones and voila it worked the first time.The Pixel Android would never suggest connecting manually and even when I did it manually it would connect to the Dot and then nothing would happen and then sometimes it would jump back to the normal wifi network.With the Moto Android it just worked and then I quickly set up the other two dots.I also have three wireless access points APs and if the Dot's Echo's are not all on the same AP then there is a good chance they will not all play on the everywhere group.I love Alexa.I found the Echo Dot fairly easy to set up and use.The only way I was able to use the Libratone speaker was through bluetooth.Plus to help us with simple things around the house light control and some outlets mostly.Sometimes there is too much background noise or we speak too fast.but otherwise it is indispensable to us.Setup takes less than minutes and so easy..It s Alexa and she is great.It took me some time to see how this works and I like it very much but some times it doesn't always works.I think it has more to do with my internet connection..I now have echo dots in my house and I love them.Most often the intercom drop in feature as we live in a bedroom split level house with very thick walls and we can talk to each other with ease using our echo.I would give it a shot what I found was it works perfectly for what I needed.I have an old stereo.t sure if the echo would support Spotify or Amazon music without a subscriptionI was pleasantly surprised that it supports both I didn t actually set up Spotify so it still might require a subscription but the Amazon music work with just a normal prime account here.My whole family loved it at first.When I tell Alexa to turn lamp on of the time she hears me saying the word light instead of lamp.I get that the first letter is the same and there are the same amount of syllables.I'm trying to figure out how to get rid of the I already own..You open the box and within minutes you re enjoying your music.but so far the Echo has met all expectations..We love this echo dot.It is a lot of fun to ask Alexa questions and plays the right kind of music.It was easy to set up and fun to use.Very helpful.Liked my Echo Dot so well that I have purchased two more for the house I use the reminders constantly instead of writing myself note reminders....it now is my only alarm clock also I am now converting my entire house to a smart house with smart wifi plugs throughout all controlled by voice Really like it.I first purchased an Amazon Echo and the sound quality of that item is great.I wish I was able to return it and purchase another Echo..Love it..not enough volume.I originally thought that neighbors were talking or their tv was on.Great product and very useful.I love using this in the bedroom with a smart plug to turn on the lamp along with other uses..This is my th Alexa and my kids love it.I love this product.Absolutely love the drop in feature.I will be buying more..IT's okay in a bedroom or playroom.The sound is not that great.but it's worth the price..This little device was wonderful very much a pleasing addition to the gizmos we rely on everyday...until that is it suddenly and inexplicably ceased connecting to the bluetooth intercom system we have in our home.I verified that the problem lies with the Dot and not the intercom system to which I can connect faithfully and easily with every other device.Setup can be a bit wonky but great product.I have an autistic son and with alexa we you her for reminders till I get home and ge is also able to send me messages till I get home..ordered for kids as Christmas gifts after I enjoyed mine.The Echo Dot is good.It's ok if you're playing music for yourself at your desk as background music.but it lacks the full rich sound of the Echo..Got this to add to my bathroom mainly for getting all my morning info while getting ready for the day.Pleasantly surprised by the sound quality and am now also using it for tunes while in the shower..I wish it would understand more of the questions I ask.but it's my favorite new toy..Cool little Gizmo.It is still training me so it can be both amusing and irritating at the same time.Nice for managing music as well as the smart lights in our home..I love it.yes I could go on and on Love it.Love it..Pretty handy little device.I mainly use it as a timer.I don't really need it.but it's fun to have anyway.Easy to set up and easy to use.Love this small handy thing.Speaker works pretty well.Still learning all the capabilities of this device but we love it so far.Connecting or linking other devices is pretty simple too.Love that I can say Alexa...turn on the pump and it triggers a remote outlet to turn on the pump.and it triggers a remote light switch that turns on the porch lights.The shopping cart or to do list features are nice too.Works great.I can barely hear it in my shower.I love talking to Alexa.I could go on and on and barely tap the surface.Love it..Love it.Listen to more music now..Doesn t seem to be a useful product for me.Love ANY Amazon products.Great to have Echo Dot Alexa around the house.Connects the whole house.Fun product..Alexa is very responsive no matter who misusing it or what their voice seems to sound like.I honestly am creeped out by this..Great value for my money.cant live without now.Amazing awesome little device Loved it after minutes having it.Alexa is the best.Stopped working and had internal problems just outside the pitiful six month warranty and Amazon told me to buy a new one.They offered a discount and thought they were doing the right thing.Using at school for my special needs classroom.The echo is not as intelligent as google assistant.So many question it can't answer and it's not recognize the contextual conversation..Helped me solving my problem turning on and off my light that has no switch.Need better instructions..Received a prime membership exclusive promo code to get this nifty smart device for bought it instantly received it the same day with free same day shipping and so far I'm enjoying it nice thing to have for weather music alarms..Works amazing.I have dots and love having then spread out about the house.Not bass ready sounds more like a toy for a minor.I didn t expect that it has such a good quality.For such a small speaker it does have great sound..Loved these at first.Really spectacular invention for the.The difference is the size and sound.The dot has a cheap sounding speaker but works really well with Bluetooth speaker.Love it.Love echo dots.Weather reports and times are so handy I couldn't go without Alexa again..I absolutely love these.After purchasing the first one and experiencing its versatility I immediately began purchasing other units for various areas of my house.We have them integrated with Philip's Hue bulbs Wemo light remotes and Lux thermostats and now our's built home is a smart house We are living like Iron Man and it's awesome.Great features and very easy to use.Easy set up.Very happy works perfectly..Very happy with the dot.Love it.Good.I enjoy figuring out the proper verbiage to get an answer..It was very easy to set up.It works awesome.The sound is pretty quiet..It s not very loud i don t really like it like i thought i was going to..I love this Listen to music use as an alarm clock timer plus much more.Great size for the bedroom.Perfect size yet able still do everything my Echo is able to do as well.Excellent.Love the unlimited music anf Alexa nusic suggestions according to my preferences...My young sons like this for bedtime music.This product is just fun Recommend by friends at work.I m sure I haven t.But my kids have a fun time asking it questions.Excellent.Love all of our Echo products.This product is great I love Alexa.Enjoy it.I love Alexa.It s really good.I use it for business it s great..Works just as intended good substitute for a alarm clock as well..Love

music.Very responsive use it all the time.Loving it.We love those.All the kids ages to use it very easily..Love it.I loved this little thing... until I got the echo and now the sound quality bothers me.It s a super useful thing to have around though.I REALLY.DO Like this Particular product because it acts like my personal assistant as well as an Search Engine..It's fun to play with.My wife and kids love asking her to play music.Great device.Love it.I like that I can drop in to other rooms of the house and add to my shopping list more.I don't really like the sound quality that much..Love this set up..Excellent product.Great sound..Works great.Very happy with this purchase.Easy to talk to and receive information from..Works amazing.Love all it can do.The speaker is obviously not as good as the full size but it also appears that the microphone is not as good.Frequently have difficulty with the wake words as well as commands..Love the echo dot.Works great.One works great.I really like my Echo Dot a lot.Plus I love asking her to play music for me..The echo dot is so handy when you need it.No regrets.Outstanding.Easy set up.No complaints so far..The start up was easy from there I havent thought of what to do with it..Super nice.Very happy with it.I love that she is just perfectly there whenever I need her..Love it.Love it.We have two love these little Echo Dots..I like that it is small enough to be out of sight yet strong enough as the Echo.Pretty easy to set up.Went with the Amazon Music Unlimited to make the purchase better.Bought some Smart switches.Fun toy...Love it gives info plays games plays music wakes me up..I most often use her to check time.I've struggled for a long time with keeping on top of things.Being able to keep lists that can be accessed at the grocery store has helped keep me on point when shopping.It wakes me every morning and it doesn't annoy me with a blaring beeping noise every morning like old style clocks.She is great with a quick timer.She's quick with basic math problems.Her basic weather reports are decent and accurate as long as you put in your address.Her question answering skills are basic at best.but I'm sure she will grow as Amazon continues to grow her AI database.I know I've only scratched the surface as there are many useful skills that can help me..Alexa is GREAT entertainment and helpful too.Super convenient because I cook a lot.I live in my kitchen and when I run out of a spice or item I just add it to my list.Nice little extra to have around..Easy to use and set up.My first Echo Dot stopped working.Amazon replaced it right away.My second Echo is working beautifully..Syncing together and set up is nice and it has all the perks of the echo.As one who purchased Amazon Echo Alexa as soon as it was available to the general public I had high hopes.Knowing that it was a new use of existing technology I was patient with Amazon as it worked to iron out the wrinkles on the way to fulfilling its promise that this cloud connected device would constantly be improving.However Amazon chose to focus more on adding advanced features than on perfecting the basic features.So Echo can do many things poorly and nothing well.It plays songs fine when it's able to find them but even that is hit and miss if two bands have similar names or if Alexa has no idea how the band names are pronounced for instance it used to call Sugarland Sir Garland.To reiterate the Amazon Echo does many things but does nothing well..Love this product.It is truly amazing what can be answered and what you can learn.Perhaps the Google Home product is more reliable..why use your phone for music when Alexa can do it all for you.Makes your life just a little better..Just watch your settings my year old accidentally ordered a tire repair kit.Great little item.Perfect addition for my kitchen.This has been a great addition to my classroom I am able to use it without students to stream music from my phone.The students are able to ask her how to spell words the weather what time it is etc..Love this little chick.Works great Good sound quality for the size.Easy ish to set up.I love having dot all the houses.They are so easy to use my kids love them.I wish the sound had better quality..Alexa is great....Timers in the kitchen are so easy to set you just ask her to do it.seriously this little device is really handy.I use this mostly for timers and music.My daughter does enjoy some of the games too.This product family Echo and Amazon have done a superb job of creating a product that performs one task and does it exceptionally well.The MMI Man Machine Interface portion of technology is by far the most difficult and challenging.Partnering with skills provides the marketing and functionality demarcation point to allow various industries to focus on what they do best.Great item sounds great especially if you connect it to a bluetooth speaker.Love having music where I want it without a bulky radio..Love it.The Echo Dot is a fun and even useful device to have around the house.We ask it all kinds of off the wall questions and enjoy its comments.One of the most used features is having it tell us jokes which are almost always serious groaners.I should really get another one for greater coverage in the house..Great.My new toy.....I m totally in love.I love the echo dot.I mainly use to listen to audio books around the house while doing chores..Great source of info when needed without the hassle of searching..Works great.It s ok.Easy set up..I absolutely LOVE IT.When.This is a bug that needs to be fixed.I loved having Alexa added to my bedroom now I can turn out the living room light from the bedroom.We love Alexa..Awesome product.Works great does not take up too much space and easy to add or remove programs..My mom and dad would not give me my first one back....so I had to order more.I love using it to play music.Workd perfectly..Poor sound quality it is incomparable to Echo devices.Love it.Love it.Sound is not good.Perfect with the attachable speaker its not loud enough by itself.However its cool if you just want soft music playing in the background while exercising or for audio books..Both my children and LOVE talking to Alexa....they have a blast and her responses are priceless.I love that we can listen to amazon music from the dot.Also the speaker is great quality If you check periodically they will have the lightening deal and they sell for about Once that happens we will get one for each room.I keep Alexa in the kitchen and it's perfect because it syncs with my Sonos Speaker..Just ok.Google is much better.THE BEST THING EVER.Love my Alexas and love the price i got them for.The dot works okay.The sengled hub and bulbs are a complete nightmare.I don't want to spend hours trying to figure out how to get'smart' bulbs to work.Love the size and how easily it blends in with the room.I use Alexa for many things but my favorite feature is find my phone.just ok.I asked it to play Hanukkah music and it played such strange music I asked again saying popular Hanukkah music.Love it.Had fun setting it up with them and showing them questions they can ask.They really liked the weather store hours and calculator.My grandson love this to play games and songs on.Love playing games and listening to my Sirius radio..I absolutely love the Echo Dot.I only need a few more then my home will be complete..The rest is good..I d like to know if you would send me a new device as this started happening about months after receiving the device.Started doing that aug and the available return windows was to aug st nice of Amazon to make things that quit like a car the day after warrenty.....Followup Changing from To Amazom support contacted me to resolve issue will change to if it works right next week doing a factory reset seemed to fix problem to do that press and hold for seconds the volume buttons and mic button.Mine works great.I love them both and my dot is great.weather timer quick knowledge resource etc.This Dot is awesome.Easy to setup and very cool item.Kids love it too..My ten year old loves Alexa.I love her for setting alarms timers and reminders so far.You definitely want to be a part of Amazon Prime students w university acct are free for six months especially if your kid is always saying Alexa play.By Justin Bieber..kids loved it..we got this at a gift and are still learning what to do but have enjoyed so far.Love my Alexa.So far I love this device.I dont use it as much as I thought I would and have yet to purchase a smart device to test its smart home feature.Love it.Love being able to play any song I want by simply asking Alexa.Other than that love it.I said Alexa play s songs and it chose top country ..I love the idea I can listen to music hands free.I am on a fixed budget and.I will have to really think about it..Works great.But still works as good as my echo..I love my echo dot.We purchased it to go with our other smart devices..Great product I bought.Exactly as described.I loved the echo dot.I mainly got it for listening to music and not being interrupted by commercials like on the radio.Perfect for what I wanted.So handy I have two.right now I will be buying more.We use it mostly for music and to get the weather.Perfect addition to our echo family..quick shipping great product works great.The sound quality is amazing.I bought an echo dot for the kitchen because I thought the sound would be not quite as excellent but good and the small size was preferable for the countertop.The cheaper price was really why I went with it tho.There is no comparison between the sound of two devices.It s the difference between Bose and an old handheld transistor radio..Love it.Very nice Doesnt sound the best when playing music but as time goes on im sure they will improve it or offer a external speaker.Otherwise great time saver.Love it great for getting news.Adequate sound quality.Good value..she is so limited next to Google she needs to be asked in a certain language to retrieve simple things like sleep music and some questions that have to be worded specifically for her.Great little gadget with plenty of power.We already have smart phones smart TV and now even more intelligent Echo Dot.It is convenient quick and reliable.No fake facts here Gives us notifications on our shopping orders plays music answeres questions and never says See I told you so.Love it.My son loves setting his morning alarm with whatever song he thinks like will make him feel good when he wakes up.When I'm in the kitchen I listen to my favorite radio station or my current Audible book and love being able to set multiple named timers as I cook.The grandkids get a kick out of asking Alexa what time it is or what day of the week it is and she tells great knock knock jokes.and it's much better than yelling upstairs when dinner is ready.I'm always learning new ways to use my Dots through blogs and Pinterest.Synchronization between devices is great.I have the bigger echo and sounds great.Bought as gift person I gave it to love it.Great little gadget Does a lot more than I expected Great price too.I love that I can have this device available in any room.I love it.Automating different items in my home really is a great thing for me.Awesome companion.She works when she wants and how she wants.Great if you buy all the lights.It s probably us but we tried our best..Great looking unobtrusive version of Echo answers almost all my questions keeps track of Amazon shipments wakes me up etc.I love it.I really like that I can control my smart home gadgets by voice.Cool.If you have a really clear loud and robotic voice then you re good.But if you re in the southeast me and have the slightest southern dialect me getting Alexa to turn the living room light off example can become a real challenge requiring multiple attempts and time wasted.Smart home technology should ease effort.I m sure I could do several things to improve my Alexa experience like.For example I could change the voice command from Alexa turn the lights down to Alexa purple banana and the voice recognition would be able to differentiate the command better from similar commands that sound alike.More of a constructive criticism than a complaint really because I really like the product.Price is great product is cool and good quality with a nice fit and finish.Since Alexa is so popular we often hear advertisements via tv or radio that will wake Alexa and the software will respond randomly.Funny at first annoying several hundred times later It should learn my voice and other household users to better understand who is giving commands.And FYI I might be a southerner but love that West coast vibe.But I still want to control my Alexa even in the southeast Haha.So many wifi outlets now.Its awesome.Love it.Handy and fun.This unit is great for basic voice control timers alarms clocks weather checks etc...I was not sure if i would like the echo dot or if i would find it useful.but I started to enjoy it the moment i took it out of the box.i use it every day feom helping me to relax and go to sleep to entertaining my son.alarms and timers or just asking about general information.the echo dot is a very useful tool ..It's perfect to supplement the Echo for commands.but I think a better speaker could have been used..there are some better sounding compact speakers available...Also I would prefer to be able to play music off of both devices simultaneously.Isn t very useful lacks quality sound.Product is great mini speaker.Works good..Love it.I love my echo dot Seriously considering buying another one.I love all the skills I can set it up to do for me.My husband and I love playing jeopardy every night..I have truly enjoyed my echo.I love asking for a joke lol.I love the this item.it sounds good..Nice to have access to music pandora in the garage..I love this product.I love it.They are super cool.they are awesome they sound great and it truly a base when using or asking it to play whatever you want.....so its an amazing product but be warn.lol.also its super cool because if she facetimes me i simply yell alexa play tupac hail mary and wala she does it even though im over the phone...we love Alexa.but we wish the speaker was louder and had better clarity and range.I love it.I received it as a gift from my boss and it is great.I love being able to relax and play my music whenever I want and.I m a sound tech and that really matters to me.alexa herself is cool.I just wish I get a better unit with better quality sound.I loved my Echo Dot but it failed after about a year and a half.Just stopped working one day and always shows a blue light.First I would to add that I love the Alexa echo plus and dot.So I can t say much about it only that I realize it.and I m looomg forward to learning how to use it better to my liking.Maybe later I can add more info..Love my little dot.,She always tries to play stuff from amazon fire TV.and she tries to play it from fire TV.I am a very tech savy person and feel bad for the elderly trying to use this product.Plus her speaker quality is EXTREMELY disappointing.By using the Drop in feature I can now ask my wife questions from the other side of the house.The options are endless as It has all the abilities of the internet with a simple verbal AI interface.Although the general search ability is not nearly comparable to Google home alexa regularly fails to answer simple questions.Which is annoying...What I expected..so I was afraid that the spotty school WiFi would cause my Alexa to frequently lose connection with my lights and other devices but even with the school.Makes a lazy guys life a whole lot easier when you can turn things on off or change colors of lights by using your Alexa..If I paid each I would be unhappy with the value compared to the regular Echo.Overall Not Impressed..not sure.I use it for everything music alarms weather information for wireless remote to lights.The silence is now laughter or at least giggles.My only real complaint is the smart devices they try to bundle it with.I am pretty disappointed and won t buy another Echo again.I give it a star due to set up problems.At least she knows the outside temperature and humidity..However I recommend hooking it up to a speaker as the music from the device itself is not very loud.Play music ask stupid questions and just talk to me. ..Does everything I expected it to do.I don t like that the music is very limited even though I have Amazon Prime that s very irritating.Every time I ask it to play a song it says that is not available due to No membership to amazon music I almost feel like I should have bought an Apple speaker.The only thing I m not happy with is the speaker.In feature it s very hard to hear the speaker..I wanted to use it on my deck but the internet signal is not strong enough.But nope the same song it said it could play via their music service failed of the time I have NEVER been more frustrated by a piece of smart technology...it s freaking retarded.Complete waste of money..Alexa what temperature should chicken be cooked to Alexa set my bedroom light to.My hands are all covered with chicken residue and I forget what temperature chicken should be cooked to No problem Alexa knows.The only person who is not impressed by what I can do with it is my cat.He's very hard to impress though..I like the reminder feature as I can be forgetful.When I'm in my room asking Alexa to do something my other device in the den picks up as well.poor quality speakers and you can not play amazon music without an additional per month charge..I'm not sure.I like how I can ask it to play random songs.i other hand.i just realized that the color i ordered was white and the one i actually have is black.The to be hated part is of time it failed to work as promised.. main reasons include network disconnection for no reason Alexa failed to recognize the comments and Alexa just decided not to work.And all of these happened few weeks after retiring period was over.I had a live chat with Amazon technician tried to resolve the to be hated items.and I might got into the technician at a wrong time as not only nothing was resolved but also was treated pretty rude.So still love and hate compared to love and hate on my Google Home..Speakers are absolutely terrible.Less chance of water accidents..Pain in the butt when you can say the same thing twice regarding turn off bedroom lights and one time she doesn t and the other does.Small and still has all the features.Bought at least for me and gifts..Difficult to get back into games..I don't see why this is difficult to do.RIDICULOUS.Amazon makes it difficult..I didn t know what I was missing.I don't remember a single misunderstood command.Horrible speaker quality.This was not the easiest to set up and the volume for the alarm is not very loud..Difficult to connect hook up however.disappointed.I like the little thing I can automate my house with it.and it had a hard time hearing me now.I make an effort to speak loudly slowly and clearly.And lastly with tasks or requests that are less routine and more complex by far the most common response is sorry.In or years we are going to look back and realize that Alexa was at least at the time of this review glitchy and limited..Not sure why it s doing that but other than that annoyance we like it..But that s to be expected I guess.After days of phone calls to Amazon being repeatedly transferred and placed on hold Amazon still failed to activate this useless device.Customer service also communicated poorly.After almost years of being a customer I was extremely disappointed.but now I am addicted to using it for alarms.Sorry I'm having trouble understanding right now.It sits hidden and controls all my lights in my house.The sound quality is terrible compared to the Echo nor does it go very loud.Gets frustrating at times because Alexa doesn't understand my request.A little buggy.It took me an unnecessary amount of time over an hour to manage to connect the Echo to my internet.Also Alexa randomly talks despite no one mentioning the name.I'm also not thrilled about it always having to be plugged up.I spent about an hour on the phone performing various technology gymnastics none of which solved the problem.I am having to consider repurchasing the broken device.What a disappointment..Initial set up also sucks took over an hour to connect.Unable to hook it up to use it..The speakers are weak on the dots so it's not always pleasurable.Complained to customer service and was offered off purchase of new dot.What a disappointment..I have to connect to another speaker if I want volume and bass when playing music.It almost feels as if I am talking to an AI with limited access of information..Hard part is realizing you don't have to SHOUT at it.Creapily enough... she can hear you from the other room.and i mean everything.Had a little problem with setup but got it figured.I haven't bothered leaving a review because it hasn't made me this mad until this morning.I was not a happy camper.There is a picture frame behind her.It was a gift which is the only reason I use it but this morning I was so angry I would have broken it if it wouldn't have taken so much energy.I hate it.This gadget is not worth it.It's got rave reviews from thousands of other people though so maybe I've got a lemon.I hate it..That is frustrating.We still recommend Echo for its other services..As a person with limited mobility it s a must have..My only complaint is that theres no way to switch from internal speakers and aux output.output seem clumsy should be easier way to switch from the two.We have not had them long and are not utilizing all of their capabilities yet.They re like having a personal assistant music DJ game show host storyteller personal shopper etc.and it even knows jokes not very good ones.but it tries.I ask about my schedule for the day and what my commute into work looks like and she lets me know both what I have scheduled and whether I should take an alternate route into work due to traffic concerns.The ONLY negative I have found thus far is that as I walk around the house and notice that I need to add multiple items to my shopping list I must individually give separate commands to each and every item to be added to list i.e. if I need paper towels bacon and toothpaste I must say Alexa add paper towels to the shopping list.Anyway it s minor and certainly not a deal breaker.It is hard for us year olds to catch on.I was disappointed to realize that it is not a wireless device which makes sense when you realize the marketing suggests putting them all over your house.Pointless unless you have other smart things to go with it.I like that its loud and small.I went shopping for one to put in my little girl s room to use as an intercom for waking her in the morning without waking her baby siblings calling everyone for dinner etc.but that's not enough to make me hate it.Not excited that I paid extra for the gift bag and card for my sisters birthday.and we were never able to get it to stop.Low price for use in other rooms of my house.I like the small size.Very disappointment in the customer service..a little known secret that works.Was disappointed that it does not link tour main device..It took a little to set up but has performed as expected.I am usually asleep before the sounds end.but I was so wrong.I usually have to have it times before I get what I actually asked for.I usually use it for my bathrooms because I have Alexa everywhere.I have little use of my arms and no use of my hands or fingers.The set up wasn t too complicated and it s so easy and convenient.Alexa has very little trouble recognizing what we are saying...even my five year old son who can struggle to speak clearly.Instructions to connect to internet were not clear.I have two Dots one upstairs and one down.and I talk constantly everyday about all subjects.Been using it for a few days now and wonder how I ever got along without it.Not loud at all.but it s not super responsive.Worked as expected.We just learned how to announce things house wide..The other is some days it just does not recognize my voice or command.Also use it to play music as our twins wind down and go to bed.It doesn t pick things up as well as it could and sometimes it will randomly turn off my music a lot..U can have ur hair curled in few minutes.Alexa is a little hard of hearing and i feel i have to almost shout for her to hear and understand me at times.My complaint is that Amazon music wants me to pay for another subscription with a different device.Sorry Amazon.Search and response too poor..Not sure yet how I feel about it..Sound quality is absolutely terrible.Speaker sound quality very poor.I like that you can be on the other side of the house and ask this echo dot to turn on lights play music.Have spent countless frustrating hours trying to diagnose fix that particular issue.Working as expected..The price made me a little skeptical but he product has done away with any skepticism I had.Works in conjunction with our other devuces and can be added to groups to play music throughout the house.Did not understand the accent even though it claims fast learning and all Doesn t allow me to play songs from YouTube which sucks and just felt it s overrated.Sound quality poor compared to other echo devices.They are the most useless electronic devices in my house and that includes any that are broken.I can ask it simple questions such as when did Andre Agassi play his last tennis game and the answer that I get out of of what I ask is hmmm.If I have to keep ability of looking it up online then this stupid Amazon thing should be doing the exact same thing.and it was unable to do it.I don't know that is all i get This device is so frustrating.It might be useful if you've got a smart house with all your devices and lights wired into your network but just as a general use to do other things it's useless.Which makes it is less usable.Only weak points are the volume and lack of bass.I am not tech illiterate but am not super savvy either.I learned very quickly not to put an echo dot two close to the Echo because everyone talks at once.If it wasn't so funny it probably would have been irritating.Annoying..Only problem is paring it to a Bose wireless speaker without it triggering other echo Alexa systems in the home.I mean it isn t even a year old.I like I can move this unit into other rooms.It s more like A stupid or AS..The things she can do are boundless.Drop in could be a little less awkward not sure how to fix that though if I'm being honest..Also it's hard to guess what words have to be strung together for the Echo to do what one wants..The only thing that sucks is that it has to be plugged in in order to work.A little difficult to pair with secondary device..I like this small personal assistant that has integrated so seamlessly into my daily life.It is hard for Alexia to understand my favorites from iHeartRadio and Sirius XM.Great all around gifts.Decent speaker for such a little thing.My kids ask it all kinds of crazy questions she doesn't know the answer to...I ask to play rain sounds here's a station you might like reggae music ... or play nature sounds hmm I'm not sure..Was a waste of s.Plain and simple.When I want to listen to music the little speakers are not good enough for music but Bluetooth speakers ir wired speakers solve that problem..TERRIBLE speaker.terrible quality and low volume potential.Coolest little speaker for a small to medium room.Like other Amazon devices.this Echo Dot is just a half baked idea.It is low quality and loses connection to WiFi everyday.but it s confusing to attach the lights and the alarm to it.Not very updated to music hard to get the music I like.Not very familiar with it just yet.Advertising doesn t show you have to use a cord bought to use by pool no cords very disappointing need to return..Like a little sidekick..I use the dot as an auxiliary speaker however it hasn t worked out as well as expected in terms of communicating with someone in another room..This way they always connect to the one AP and I no longer get a random collection of Dots Echos playing around the house ... along with an annoyed wife..It does everything from recording shows to playing my favorite music to the cutting the lights off without me moving a muscle.I was unable to set up the Libratone Scene with Echo Dot using WIFI.Although Siri is very limited with its applications compared to Amazon Alexa.I have Siri with Homepod less complicated and more predictable to use..The speaker is a bit weak..was not what i expected.I like this device my son told me I was going to hate it he told me to get a different version by a competitor I decided for the that it was on sale.I've had my echo dot just shy of years.but it seems that after every update it gets significantly worse.I can be within a single foot and she still won't hear me.There are other times when I will ask Alexa to set an alarm or to start a timer and she will but it will mysteriously cancel somewhere in the middle which is highly inconvenient.Needless to say I won't be buying any additional echos.I got it a little bit ago.Not impressed with the quality of the speaker.The speaker in the Dot however is less than mediocre.I like the small size and big volume.I started hearing very faint sounds and conversations in my house.Alas the mystery solved...Can neighbors with Alexa can hear me too I called the Amazon Echo call center and was told I needed to buy their security program to solve this Echo reality.is disappointing.Very difficult to set up and use.I read and followed all directions but was unable to get it to link to my FireTV or play music from my Amazon Music Unlimited account.and I use it to play music other than that.This speaker barely wakes me up in the morning due to being so quiet.Fun gadget a little scary.Damn thing kept turn on and off listening even when I turned off the remote listening tool.Getting it to connect to the wifi was hard.but now it sucks because I have to get new chargers needless to say it won t be these..best thing in the world in my family and the kids love it ...I have to use Pandora for one and Amazon Music for the other as both only support one streaming device with my current subscription level.Worked just as expected..Asking questions or everyday stuff.When I tried to return the more expensive echo dot it would cost. to ship back so not only did I lose out on the off promotion I was expected to pay.The other has a lag.I do recommend getting a speaker with it if you want to hear music from other rooms..AOK as expected.Disliked.My only disappointment is that my new Fire Tv k remote won't connect with this Echo.The USB cable functions well with other devices when checked.No such problems with our other Echo devices seems to be nd generation Echo Dot..I like the dot for the volume control buttons rather than telling Alexa level or level and the little son of a guns do what I tell as well as their big brother or sister ..The sound quality is very poor like listening to an old am radio.It fails to understand basic commands and often even stops listening halfway through input.Asking it to provide basic facts is generally a fool's errand and there are other issues as well.This is the second Alexa Dot that has failed.This failed in just a couple of weeks just enough time for the return deadline to expire.Creeps me out afraid to use a device that can listen.It worked before what the heck totally worthless to me if it cant do a playlist ..NOT worth it.Not very good sound but not to bad for the size.I ended up ordering a larger speaker base to use it with..Whenever I asked it to play any other genre of music it always chose weird music.I gave up on it a long time ago.Addicted to it.The quality of this speaker is not good enough.What Do You Mean.No lights no sound nothing..Work extremely well.Not happy with this device at all.It doesn t respond unless I m less than a foot away and half the time it doesn.The songs it picks are terrible.Placed these in various locations throughout the home to control lights and communicate with people in other rooms.I was wrong to cut corners.It happens to be too small for me..In function which we used like a baby monitor when Mom was sick.It's hard to imagine life without Alexa.Was disappointed at the sound quality of the dot..I m disabled and now I can turn on off all my household lights with ease if needed.I realize we are still beta testing because Alexa is in the rough but with plenty of potiential.This is really my only complaint.Totally disappointed in the volume level and wish I had purchased the larger purely for some speakers.but I got through the amazon day half off.I would totally pay for the half off larger speaker..but I have zero regrets.But as expected for it's size audio is lacking.Wish the speaker was a little louder..Very bad sound quality.I would at least five years of reliable service from this device.But Im still working with it and learning how to explore the other Things to it.,I want her to play Friends from Netflix.I have done EVERYTHING I set the default to Netflix and she doesn't care.She has been demoted by my google home mini and her ONE job is to turn off the lights.Everything I thought it would be..Excelente.Lack luster..This is my second echo dot.Sharon and I also like to listen and share music throughout the house using Amazon Prime music.Received mine as a gift and thinking I would never use it...updates guided meditation alarm clock to my choice of music and so on...I used to Google inquiries all the time.and this is now the way of the future.It not always understand what I say and when I say to play some radio it go to play.it was sorta a package deal.WiFi.We have two in the house now and are waiting for a sale to pick up a third.Use the Alexa app to set daily alarms and my kids can operate them to hear jokes check the forecast before getting dressed set timers and listen to Pandora radio..but it seems to drop out easily...giving the orange circle of death.I've reset the thing three times.Music alarm info....etc..Now I got a WiFi switch.Just getting started it looks like.Very addictive..Music.Finally bought one to try.Daunted by the silence I say Alexa tell me a joke.Alexa tell me a bedtime story...After this I also bought wifi electric plug Nest etc.She doesn't control my Fire tv well either.She talks out of turn with out saying anything.I got a second one for my living room.Just as described.I have followed the recommended troubleshooting steps and have even deleted the device from the app and reinstalled it.No luck.Conveniently for Kasa it is not accepting reviews for that product.I received an Echo for Christmas last year.It does have work well.my Echo Dot does nothing close to what is advertised.The problem was not at my end.There is a bit of a learning curve in getting on board with Alexa.I asked some simple questions and she is clueless.Amazon sends emails with suggested questions.This is a POS.I would not buy again.I like it.I don't like that it has to be plugged in to charge to use.but it doesn t.I sync it with my iTunes while cleaning my house.If u need a weather update just ask Alexa.If u need a recipe just ask Alexa.If u want to make a phone call just ask Alexa to make the call.Alarm clock timers reminders placing an order on Amazon...yeah.she does that too.Alexa has numerous capabilities that do not require the personal information invasiveness of Google Home mini received as gift.too helps me get my work done.Just say the song and she finds it.I buy these for gifts now.What's not to like except for the fact that they spy on you.So I unplug them..Alexa is a genius.Buy one you will like it.I gave this to my dad as a gag but he uses it for weather reports music and trivia..It helps me out with everything.No issues here.Bought it for my dogs to play calming music during the day.We might need another one.I use the Echo Dot to entertain me when I need it.and it tells me about the news weather and commute.I can make lunches coffee and get my morning going without having to wait for the info on the TV.I now have in my home.I would definitely recommend to everyone..Ok.Received it as a gift.I'm still learning all the things it can do.I think the Drop.When using the Drop.I don t.remember ordering an echo dot.Also I never received an echo dot..Simple to set up and use.I also have dots.Not the fault of the Dot though..just add device using Alexa App.I have the Echo nd generation already ..I just ordered plugs to control the lights in my house.so I subscribed to Amazon Music.Everything I wanted to accomplish with this piece of shit can be accomplished though my phone.Alexa add comet to my shopping list.Alexa what is the weather today.I feel like I am using Star Trek technology with this thing.Oh my gosh.I use it alot.I use it as an intercom weather anything I want it to.I use Alexa for everthing.Like.This is the second dot we ve bought..but now i have to fight my granddaughter for the music..I recommend this.No problem connecting or communicating but the answers given are lacking any detail.I don't know the answer to that answers.And the answers that are given are so short that you are left feeling like there was no answer at all.just eh..I've had my Echo Dot for about a month now.I like the size as it doesn't stand out like a sore thumb on my table.He travels for work so he can get all the weather he needs in a matter of seconds.and I can talk and continue doing what i'm doing...bought these for the kids so they can stream music in their rooms and have an alarm in the morning.I now have one in every room...yep even the bathroom.Play different music multiple rooms when using different platforms Pandora Amazon Music etc..Does not take up space.Whenever I need a weather forecast timer or alarm.My daughter purchased this product after playing with her friend s Echo Dot.We were planning on using this to communicate from different ends of the house.Grocery lists.No need to upgrade every year..I bought this with the Echo thinking that Id need this In my bedroom since the bigger echo was in my den.We have the larger echo at home.and I have this in my office at work.It works as we expect it to.Alexa doesn't know anything.She always responds hmm.ECHO makes checking the forecast a snap.It's like Siri on steroids.Unfotunately one must almost yell in order for ECHO to hear requests.Also I have started music playlists but ECHO fails to recognize the names I have even double checked the app to make sure I'm calling them by the correct name.When I checked the app I learned that the I had the correct list names but that the songs were deleted.but this is only a supplement to assist in the total home experiment into the future.This item does have its limits depending on home size and wi fi coverage and you may need multiples of this item..my grandson loves the echo dot.he's ...she says hmmm.i don't know that.i'll adjust...I got it for my boys room.Daughter loves this.I play music on it all the time.Take it out by the pool.so don t buy it for listening to music.I added the hanger to keep it up off the countertop.Save your money.Audio is lacking when using for music.Just as advertised.I call my sisters name.Music just stops sometimes.I'm now using her for just about everything.The ease of setting up.To control you ch and DVR and guid.I like the fact it is an Alarm Clock.I was given the larger Echo as a gift.I bought this specifically to use in my car.It WILL NOT reconnect to the same hotspot same phone same network name after I disconnect and come back to my car.so I can hook up Alexa.And add minutes every time I get gas or stop and shut off my car.Seems simple.Works as well as her larger sibling..I use it to tell me the time or weather every day.I also use it to play music.They keep Alexia hopping with big band music..Works as promised.Just weather music local alerts.I bought the Dot for a nd guest room.so my guests could control the Hue lights.I have install there.For the price you can not beat it..Took separate try s to make Bluetooth connect to Echo you also needed to program each persons individual voice for the dot to follow any command.Works well with Speech Generated Devices..Use a lot for music and just for information.Echo dot nd generation is everything I thought it would be.Delivered as promised.I got it on prime day with my Fire stick.and I can ask Alexa the weather or quote of the day.I am looking at the Echi Show for my next purchase..It only works with amazon.didnt know that.What else can you ask for.I keep adding...very addictive.It works.Hooray for Amazon..Never got it to sync to my phone.The only thing I had to move it closer to me.I had put it next to the TV.it does.But I cannot count the number of times that Alexa has misheard me.She does NOT work well with Spotify.I don't know that one.Echo.so I decided to buy this dot to use in the basement with a bluetooth speaker and my Hue lights etc.Well this thing can never understand you.Literally have to say about times or just turn off the lights yourself.It also has problems finding radio stations because it can't hear what you're saying properly..Was this amazons plan all along They suceeded..but it tends to skip go out while we re listening to music.Not a fan.I like it.I am an Apple person two iMacs two MacBook Pros iPhones and iPod touch Apple TV.The dot was a purchase to use on the deck.If your gonna buy one get the larger one.I have four of them and they work well in hold house music.Got it for my mother.She is fascinated by it.The Echo Dot integrated well with my Insteon Hub from Smarthome.com.Writing off anything related to and or driven by their proprietary digital assistent..Not getting into the specifics. ...need briefing in the morning and controlling my tech of course..And is always playing music for me in my house.But besides that it is just like ny echo.No complaints here..The echo dot has met my expectations.Alexa doesn't know a lot or even understand what we ask her.Still learning about her..Lots of limitations.The door only works to.so the echo dot can play louder in the water so I can hear my music.Have an Echo and just wanted the dot for another room where i don't listen to music often.It is not rechargeable.Only works on AC power.Has potential but not up to snuff.It is raise.I wish it was wireless.This device definitely has potential though..How do you register the dot once you'r connected to wifi.It won't let me register..I bought the echo.After trying to reset and connect the unit using the help section of the app I contacted Alexa customer service.I don't like that it HAS to be plugged in to use also when you ask it to play a song it never works.Alexa play insert song here on Spotify and it never finds the song.Depending on the song title it's a lot to say for it to not work.I ended up giving it to my mom..I can be in bed and turn lights off and on.There's a lot it can't do or access.but there's lots.it does..Does not come with instructions.I used my second Alexa to work with my living room speakers.It is also a convenience to have in another room..Makes me wonder what I did before her.Bought this for my Dad.I dont like the limitations of selection of music unless you subscribe to Amazon Prime music..I wanted to wait for a month or two before submitting this review.I have had the device for a month now.An example I tried three different methods to get an audiobook I had been listening to just the night before.I have to raise my voice substantially before the device will respond.It doesn't always listen to what you are saying before it goes off on another selection that you don't want.This happens regularly with music.It goes off line if there is break in the electrical connection no battery backup.I like to listen when I am soaking in the tub.I like to keep my shopping list up to date.I don't forget things anymore because the device keeps track for me.This is invaluable to me.If and when I can get it to read my audiobooks.it's a pleasure.In spite of the problems the dot has me spoiled and I would not go back to being without it..Just wish it had a louder speaker..Received as a gift.I wish the dot was wireless itself not dependent on USB for power.Worked until weeks after warranty expired.No thank you.I like the accessibility.I don't like the selectiveness since it is everything amazon.I can only play music from my amazon music and spotify accounts.I have to unplug it when I'm leaving from home.and then it takes a minute or so to load when replugged.Also it's not a speaker per say therefore.But my phone is in my hand all the time.so it hasn't added much to my daily routine..ALEXA just grows on you one begins to rely on Alexa on several tasks..Echo Dot Alexa makes my life a lot easier. from setting up my alarms reminders to simply asking her about my commute.However I wish that Alexa had a broader scope of knowledge.We like to listen to music ask questions and the Echo does it in seconds.We have it hooked to a Bose speaker which makes it louder.This is the nd one I've purchased.I use one in the house and one in my sunroom so my bluetooth speakers will work on the deck.I.HAVNT.USED IT.YET.BUT I WILL AND.IM.About February the two of us were chatting about carpet and soon ads were popping up on my computer.Twice without prompt this device would seem to activate and make questions for children I do not have children.Therefore I unplugged this device and gave it to someone who does and hopefully this is the end of that.Works well.I also have a Amazon Tap Alexa Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker.You have to push a button to activate it.That's why we have both devices.We are using Echo Dot in our bedroom to play music as we go to sleep.I wish the volume could be louder..That also means she's listening and recording EVERYTHING you say.There will be can be no secrets.Keep that in mind.Our echo.out.love it.I've had this thing for about months now and she doesn't listen.Well I've started using her for my alarm in the mornings.This morning at AM.and I scrambled over and pressed them all.and she finally stopped.Remember this is AM.She is only about feet away from me and there is nothing above or in front of her at all.but that's it.Whatever.When i want to use it just for morning alarm i have disconnect.aux.Doesn t do much that is useful difficult to program scheme to force you to buy music subscription..Would not buy again.Might actually return it for a google home..She has it connected to a soundbar and plays music from Amazon music.We use it almost like an intercom system since we have several throughout the house.I like having the freedom to set times by just saying it as well as knowing the weather..I clicked on Connect.the Tech got almost to the en but times at that point.I lost Internet connection and also the connection with the Tech.So what am I suppose to do now Earlier I asked for a phone call I got it.but I couldn't understand a word what the Tech was saying.My connection went to India..Ease of setup.ASK THE QUESTION.A SECOND TIME.SHE LEARNED THE ANSWER LOTS OF TRAINING TO GO.I use this product as my alarm clock.etc.etc.all rolled into one.But it also gets used to remind me about appointments as a timer for food that I am cooking and as a means to make my grocery shopping list.It changes the channels for my DirecTV.Alexa add bacon to the shopping list.Alexa add toothpaste to the shopping list.Instead of just saying Alexa add paper towels and bacon and toothpaste to the shopping list.Perhaps as they continually update the software this will be one of the things that they improve upon..This is the th I have installed in my home no additional automation yet but maybe in the future..This works well.Amazon you delivered again thank you.I even have my thermostat connected to it.Still trying to figure everything out.But what I have learned works well.This device is NOT a music centered speaker.This is for home automation and voice command stuff shopping lists lights on and off weather forecast stocks etc.If you want a device to jam to use the Echo or the Tap or connect a speaker to the Dot.It's entry level basic..but this is what I bought them for.I use it for shower music.Wish it was rechargeable vs plug in.You put it with a snow flake card.It s not winter and Missouri is not Alaska..We upgraded to the family version of Spotify so we could use it on the Alexa and it would never work.Also after about two weeks it started echoing whatever was on our TV synced with our dish network system We never requested it to do that.We called customer service and no one can ever help us.Eventually we just unplugged it and never used it again..I like having the Dot to travel with and managing my music news feeds forecasts alarms even in a rent car on the road.Use it to control my stereo when home in the office..She gets you whatever you want to listen starting your day.I already have an Echo.So I added this Dot in the bedroom.I was charged..the day I purchased this..Our th echo dot.they are please as well.Para todo.it works.I finally got one.and it was very simple to hook up and to use..It needs ring home security to sync with it.It s not as intuitive as I thought it would be.Can t follow commands I think should have been simple to program into it..Needed the output jack and it has it.None of the others do.This is my nd Dot.I put it in the bathroom.Personally not a fan of Alexa.Alexa.Wish I would have bought two on Amazon Prime day.The Echo Dot keeps getting an error when playing music.Repeats over and over this is the last song starting over during play of the song.I called customer support and the rep advised it was a bug and for me to notify Amazon and keep an eye out for updates.I then tried to get a replacement and was emailed to try to remove device and add back.I did this and it didn't work.I then went to try to return but I am out of time.you can t beat it....for bedside music and news.she will ask you.What do you want to hear.basically asking for a station you have on Pandora.in advance..We use it off our Pandora play list for music ask it for time and alarm and the weather.Which is all we needed..Follow all instruction will not connect to my wifi.Use for inside and outside areas..gift for a friend.Gave this as a gift..I have been using my Echo in my bedroom as a sleep aid.I understand the internet connection but had many difficult hours of trying to hook up the dot.I had it unplugged for several days then decided to give it another try.Have no idea.My daughter loves it.I purchased this for my sister in law who is.Still learning different what all I can do.they use it for spelling words.Just don't have it in a room where there is a tv on because it will start talking.Also for some reason it doesn't give me the information I ask for.For example I will ask for today's horoscope by Susan Miller for Virgo and she answers the horoscope for today by Elle Twin Sisters is.She does that for songs as well.Haven't figured out how to fix that..El Echo Dot es tremendo equipo de tecnolog a moderna.Muy bueno para hacerte la vida.m s.f cil en el Hogar.o lugar de trabajo..This is the second one that I have bought.I use it in my AZ Home.Use this product to communicate with family members throughout the home and property.I am a quadriplegic.Thank you AMAZON..Got for mom.All the channels I want to hear.Everyone needs one in there home.Makes things simple like a traffic or weather report before you leave the house.I use the Dot every day in my office.Had to have tech help they had to get tech help.No complaints from me..My father is addictive to Alexa music.She actually listens to everything you ask for.I have them in rooms and a Echo in our family room..I cannot get locally or on XM and is helpful in the kitchen.I just wish I knew all its capabilities..I bought this for my mom.She was always asking her phone questions.I haven t asked her yet if she s using it.I hope so.When I visited her recently I has the occasion to experience ALEXA.When I got home a month later there was a package at my door.ALEXA.I am so grateful Alexa.Life changer.I already have one in my office.My husband wanted one in his office too.My wife said we need to order another one so she can have one up in her office.With Kasa it makes life luxurious.Works well for the price.Wish it were wireless..It definitely makes things easier for me.We ask it all sorts of questions and we purchased Amazon music to play songs..I like it for music.I have an Echo in the living room and put the dots in two bedrooms..Dislike speaker are low.I use this as a way for my kids to get a hold of me when they are home alone.I got two one for my room and the living room.I really only use it to play music and to ask Alexa about the news.It's like having a personal secretary ..In feature.Gives me the ability to check on my son while he's home..I like that it was discreet.you will never let it go..I have two and one echo.Luv this device.Should have purchased two.This is our third Echo and they continue to amaze us.and I play lots of music with mine.My nd echo...The reason it s a instead of is.I seem to have to go through the set up to connect to the same wireless router about once a week.Went through about different was of saying play next song and it didn t do it.I like it.I have Echoes and they all work.You can t use this product without plugging it into the wall not in the reviews or on box.But can't get consistency.Now I want one.use all the time.Bought for use in our bedroom.We currently are using the built in speaker but I plan on Joplin up to an external when we get one..Won't work with my wife fi.I have both this dot and a regular echo as well.I have to talk a litter louder to the dot which is why I give stars.I have several echoes already this was ordered for the guest bedroom.entertains me...my kids...I already pay with an echo that I have.we use it to ask questions about all things.They work well with Alexa.However TVs.Tivo do not work well.I want the Dot to play on the house system..Una magn fica.opci n para hacer m s.inteligente mi casa todo funciona de maravilla controlo casi todos los dispositivos en mi casa.sin embargo.no le doy las estrellas hasta que est en espa ol..Una magn fica.opci n para hacer m s.inteligente mi casa todo funciona de maravilla controlo casi todos los dispositivos en mi casa.sin embargo.no le doy las estrellas hasta que est en espa ol..Still learning how to use it.I actually played them one at a time.The phone sounded louder and crisper.This things speakers sounded like they were blown..I use it on my porch.I also thought I could network these things together..ask the weather for the weak..or ask it to tell you a joke.this thing like having another person in the house.Garbage Does not work..Been bout a month.I ve told everyone I know about the camera.I purchased the dome camera.Now I can watch my puppies while I m at work....I had problems programming my Echo.We've had two of these Amazon dots since Christmas.I don't know that.I asked today to multiply.by.hmmm.They have done some sort of update and now I cannot do that reminder I can only do a reminder on weekdays weekends go figure or weekly.I cannot tell it to remind me every days or every days or every two weeks or three weeks.Oh it will tell me what the weather is......big deal.I can look it up online myself..It s helpful.but it is constantly malfunctioning..We use her in the basement to turn on and off the hue lights or change colors.We ask her about the forecasted weather temp for the day before getting dressed.We ask her definitions of words.Etc..Sometimes it doesn't understand me..Can't load Saavn music skill in US.Hope they enable it in the future so that there is no restrictions..Everything.Met expectations.Although she refuses to listen probably about of the time when you tell here to snooze the alarm..I bought two echo dots while they were on sail.Can t stop using it.I can see the appeal.I read all of your info about the Echo Dot.No where did it state that it must be within feet of your router.So my Echo Dot was attached to my bedroom lamp which is feet away.It dropped WiFi connection daily.I was instructed when I called Amazon to contact my WiFi provider to get mgh strength make a change on my router settings and or buy a WiFi booster.Your sales pitch is you plug it in and connect to WiFi and voila it works.Well it didn t.It went back along with the Smartplug..It works well.I don't have to have the TV on anymore while I work.D.She comes on when not asked can't answer a lot of my questions.it is in the kitchen.and I used it as a timer.per month to use.I cannot review like you want me to.So for me.It s a rip off.I guess nothing is well made these days..I got am echo dot to add to the back room.Sometimes does not even answer.Keeps disconnecting even though in same room as router.She answers my questions plays my music her sense of humor is spot on to brighten my day.The coolest.It does not connect one request to the next one.it needs to store bookmarks or favorites.It does not recognize.me..I bought four initially now.While sometimes this device responds well to voice commands just as often it doesn't.It works just as i thought and you can even play games and call people who also have an Alexa.I just received this and still learning how to work it.I do know it can make calls to my contacts BUT DOESN'T HANG UP and does play music that I request.I will add to this as I learn what this can do.this is truly one of the greats.Poor sound quality.I also find it unacceptable that I have to purchase a separate amazon music account for this device..I now have four.They are hooked into my house lighting it's heating and air conditioning and soon the locks on our doors.They have simplified my list making for shopping and wake me up each morning.Like it.Works as advertised.Works great.wonderful product.It doesn t respond a lot of times and has to be plugged in at all times.Def wouldn t have bought this if I had known.Thank you Amazon..I also use it as a regular Bluetooth device for some musical gigs..It's like a talking Google knowledge master story teller collection of music Etc.In short its a all in one entertainment device.....I like it.no complaints here.It don't know a lot of answers to my questions.Purchased it for my wife she loves it..Perfec.A gift for my daughter she loves talking to Alexa and asking her lots of questions.A gift for a friend.I already have one.When I have physical challenges as I go through cancer treatment I know that I can operate lights w a voice command and even call my neighbors via Alexa if I need help.Really...this has been a life saver.No it does not speak Spanish.she doesn't always hear you when you say the awakening word.We use this in all the rooms of our house along with the larger echo in our living room.and I like having both my Spotify and amazon prime music played by Alexa at my request.Volume is very low and not portable battery compared to Sony.Doesn't'listen'...It was white.Music time directions and jokes.Bought it to interface with Ford sync on an F.Never did get it to work.I get an Alexa virtual assitant in almost every room in the house.My grandson loves his Echo Dot.We use it to play music.Create shopping lists timer for cooking reminders to take pills just about anything else you can think of.Got this rd.Echo for my bedroom to control lights and use for alarm.As always it totally meets my expectations.Bought this for my granddaughter's th birthday.She loves it.Information and music.When it does it also lowers the volume to minimum for some reason.I like it.Overall it works well once you get everything working together.Nothing.Portable.Versatile..I dislike being heckled to review a product I didn't buy on your marketplace..I have Alexia do a lot of things.We purchased of these.One for the kitchen son's room and office.The entire family enjoys all of the features..We now have echo dots.We remind them of their reoccurring chores at different dates times.Yes we tell them in person but out tech savvy teens get a kick out of Alexa reminding them..It was a gift for my husband.He is not at all tech minded but he uses it often..The first Dot refused to get past trying to connect to my wireless.The Dot would announce that it was connected and to finish the setup in the Alexa app.but then the Alexa app would never get off the screen trying to connect to Dot wireless.Seems the Pixel on Android couldn't cooperate with the Dot.I changed to my Moto G Plus with Android and it just worked.The key seemed to be the Moto Android would immediately say to manually connect the wifi to the Dot.Since Amazon won't let me forget a network that an Echo Dot discovered I had to rename two of my APs with names that the Echo Dot didn't know.The echo dot is the item I never knew I needed.However I intended to set up the Echo Dot using the Libratone speaker Scene.I also found using Amazon music and SirusXM to lag skip when the music is played through the Echo Dot.I also use Apple Siri with Homepod.We got the Alexa Echo.My wife and I are handicapped.The Dot has expanded it across the house.Can even on occasion decipher th garbled gibberish my children throw at her..Muy til me.encanta oigo m sica enciende mi tv mi sounbar ect gracias.This device has literally changed my life it is my alarm clock I can use it to add things to my calendar and speaker for listening to Audible while playing videogames..We use them for routines announcements an intercom system and music.and I like to listen to music I have been using Spotify and Amazon Music.I wasn.and I now no longer have to get up to change song.skip songs if it shows up by phone what s playing.and I can skip there also.She no longer learns from my requests.We have a lamp set up with a Wemo plugin that allows us to control the lamp functions with the echo.I have the lamp named lamp on both the echo and the wemo app.but it's so different sounding.Then when the room is absolutely quiet I will request Alexa to do something and she doesn't hear me.If there was background noise I would understand but there isn't.so I haven t explored all the features.Even knows the temperature outside.I have several around my home and office to play music and keep me company.I like to have our music choices playing in all of our prime places..Alexa can hear my commands wherever I am in the room..Refer to another star review that covers this topic.it's the Echos around my place.The price for months..Am just learning what all it can do..When they have another for.sale.I have yet to resolve this issue and until I do this product gets only two stars from me.BTW this problem began only two weeks after we starting using the the Dot..The only issue I have with this product is I can't figure out how to change my location for it.When I ask for the wheather it is not place of residence..I like this product..I use this product for everything.but it's lack of volume.Business.It doesn't support saavn audio app.I use my Echo Dot daily listening to music while I study and I listen to my Audible books while lounging.It is my alarm clock music player timer reminder....My daughter took this to college.and she loves it.She just wished it was portable.....wanted it to charge to take anywhere..Or Alexa...turn on the porch lights.I like the echos overall but the dot is too quiet.I wish I would have got the echo..I get weather updates baseball scores.she plays music she plays Jeopardy.All this.and I am not computer savvy.Had to move it to my bathroom for music and rely on my cell for being my alarm clock again..My shipment was delivered timely as promised..Keeps loosing signal and don't always respond to commands.I like the fact that it will play individual songs as well..Yes there is one in the settings.Piece of junk.Going with a different brand now..It's a dot.I used them for alarms drinking games grocery lists reminders and to buy stuff off Amazon.I feel that the Dot doesn t understand me as well as the larger Echos.It could be my voice or the location of it though.but I m unsure.Two of the three chargers stopped working after months.Only thing is it skips and pauses during music.About once a minute..The dot work as well as the echo.I don t have any issue with it and would recommend it for compact size and not listen to music with the built in speaker..Just like asking questions..fun.Have them all over and control lights and electrical outlets with them.Now if they could just reprogram to answer to Jarvis.....love the product.Works like a charm.Interfaces with Sonos..Can't wait to play with all the tricks it can do..and I use it on a daily basis.I have not found a difference..It works.Pandora is a bit more difficult as I have to start it from an Alexa App.This is likely because of the parental control enforced with Freetime..even began to figure out all it can do.And playing music..she is fab..I have Echos now.I even have one in my car..I like it.Tells u the weather sports scores headline news..This is my th one.Not as knowledgeable as it sounds.Bought for second room use.Works well with the firestick..I ordered the Echo Dot for my grandson's birthday.Since I only have a business account and my daughter shared a promo code with me I could not use the code.My daughter ended up ordering it on her personal account.to send it back.What is up with that.I don't sleep well at night and when I wake up at different times I can ask Alexa for the time.No.Bought two of these'cause they were on sale.Had no clue who or what Alexa was when I got these.so I can turn on my coffee maker with Alexa or my phone.She keeps me together.She leaves something to be desired when it comes to reminders but there are skills for that I am investigating.I use her for lists and timers.My kids like to use her to play music.We've been experiencing problems with the nd generation Echo Dot.Its not disconnected and only used in one location but often has no power and has to be pressed in to function again.I even bought Echo Dots and Echo Dots nd Generation.You can tell it something anywhere in the house and it's tiny.It has a wealth of information and knowledge..Over time music begins to skip cut out intermittently.Stop wasting your battery on your phone and have Alexa take care of the music.Or was it an accident........These weere gifts..I can add to my shopping lists listen to music and even make a phone call..Got it for the kid's room.Would buy again..I can't imagine life before her.Want music just ask.Need the weather.she's your on call weatherman...Seems to work well..Background functions of communicating and interfacing to hardware follow strict rules collaborative standards and has been done well in the industry for years.The one suggestion that would make this the ultimate product is to create a Echo Dot Decko with a Google Skill.Echo MMI Decko Mesh WiFi Google Enough said .....The Ultimate Device.It sits in a closet.Works as advertised.if anyone has a fix for this.I have and they all do the same thing.they just stop the playing it dosent happen if I play a radio station thru iheart so connection is not a problem.But pandora and amazon music just quit or songs in.I have the family plan thru amazon.Sometimes it s unclear what or why it turns on without any instruction..I bought the Echo for my daughter.she loves it.I purchased an echo dot for my son along with the Alexa.I see all the features this has and decided to purchase one for myself.my orders are shown on my account as delivered i will not receive the notification on my Alexa devices until a day later.Bought it as a gift for someone.I now owe of these.I hooked it up to my stereo system.Loked.I added connected it to my spot and Alexa responds depending on where I am.I like it.It is what it is.so we can have our music all over.I would definitely recommend.I didnt know I had to keep plugged in to use.Will be purchasing battery pack..This one can t recognize and distinguish two voices..Became buddy now..I got the echo dot plus sengled hub for my daughter.It's been a week.and I'm pulling my entire router out of the nether reaches of my closet again to connect a very short ethernet cable to it and then to the singled hub because it keeps disconnecting.Even when it is working I can't get alexa to turn off the lights we have to name them one by one.Alexa turn off bulb.Alexa turn off bulb.Alexa turn off bulb three Alexa responds with Bulb is not responding Ok.I could have flipped a switch on the wall ten minutes ago to get my damn lights off.I know there is a way to get them all to go off and on with one request but the software isn't intuitive enough for me to figure it out.Oh I also had to return a different sengled bulb because it wouldn't work with the sengled hub I purchased..I use it just to listen to music.I bought this because a friend was raving about it.I thought it would play music with a simple command.I n Dec.That did not help.I don't know what I need it for.I have Siri on my computer..Bought another for the grandparents.Now to print off a sheet of things they can ask her..He s only seven.That speaker is junk.I loveit for musicand weather and delivery notifications.I initially bought it to help keep grocery lists and such but now I use it to play music as well as sleep sounds and an alarm clock.Works as advertised.I have buy a separate speaker.The device seems to be having an issue staying connected to the WiFi.I ve tried connecting the device at three different locations my house work friends house.I was concerned it was an issue with my WiFi.but it appears it won t.stay connected anywhere.Thank you.drops connection to internet constantly.You will need to reconnect with the Alexa app .... till next week.I paired mine with a Bluetooth speaker and now can crank the tunes.I have alexia and now a dot.It does quite a bit of it.Totally stopped working one week after setting up.I haven't had any problems.I like I can lower the volume from both in app and the device itself.It sometimes reacts to words that are not the wake word though nothing happens after it activates.I did not expect the size of it when I took it out of its box.I did not know that it had no backup battery.so if power goes out or its not plugged in it turns off..Only issue I have is sometimes I have to yell at her to get her attention.t respond at all.Get updates on the weather.But I don't like having to pay for Amazon Music after days.mo adds up.Bought the echo dot to pair with my Echo and lights.I use it to control my lights.However it doesn t pick up voice as well.I like this..Doesn't do everything but completes simple tasks well..Pricing.I have echo second generations in both bedrooms.None.Compact.This was my third Dot.We use them every day.Then there's the Drop.Eventual linkage with NEST to happen.I never purchased this item..Eh.After that eh..Actually sent it back.We could not get it to work.Alexa isn t quite there yet.re word my preset commands to something Alexa couldn t mistake.But need to improve voice recognition.We will be there soon just not there yet..We dont use it and I want to exchange.I'd that possible.Use this all day every day.I didn't know what I was signing up for.Alexa don't ever leave...Get addition to upstairs.Next the basement..No louder than my IPad Pro.It s like I m playing my phone.To return it is another big joke.I have to pay.to return it.For the wat kmt.Do not recommend using for listening to music..but you can't..I will be upgrading to the echo soon.Dot.Works as described.Cell phones.I've already purchased for these.my girlf friend wont stop talking to alexa now.....my kids like playing questions with it..I dont like the fact it cannot be used wirelessly..No warning nothing.I have both the echo plus and echo dot in each room.It s so convenient for me.
