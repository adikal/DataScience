Echo's Little Sister,I like this smaller version which fits nicely on my nightstand and is handy without taking up much room.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Neat little device,Fun apps for kids. Nice for music in the bedrooms.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Glad I bought it on prime day,Alexa is pretty dumb but the package overall is good.,4.0 out of 5 stars
I am a very tech-savy person and feel bad for the elderly trying to use this product,"She always tries to play stuff from amazon fire TV. I want her to play ""Friends"" from Netflix and she tries to play it from fire TV. I have done EVERYTHING! I set the default to Netflix and she doesn't care. She has been demoted by my google home mini and her ONE job is to turn off the lights. I am a very tech-savy person and feel bad for the elderly trying to use this product. Plus her speaker quality is EXTREMELY disappointing. My phone sounds better. My google home mini dominates on sound quality and much more.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Great products,This is my second echo dot and I think they're great. By using the Drop in feature I can now ask my wife questions from the other side of the house. Sharon and I also like to listen and share music throughout the house using Amazon Prime music. We love it!!,5.0 out of 5 stars
alwys inproving,works as listed,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Simple, versatile, verbal command AI interface. Buy it!","A very versatile gizmo for the price. Received mine as a gift, and thinking I would never use it... I now have more, which I couldn't live without asking to playing music, check the weather, simple math, sports and stock news updates, guided meditation, alarm clock to my choice of music and so on... The options are endless, as It has all the abilities of the internet with a simple verbal AI interface. I used to ""Google"" inquiries all the time, and this is now the way of the future. While this particular item may have plenty of flaws, Amazon has clearly created something that everyone must possess.
Although the general search ability is not nearly comparable to Google home, (alexa regularly fails to answer simple questions) This is just the first generation of devices, so I'm expecting incredible improvements in the technology and massive integration of this type of artificial intelligence throughout our homes, in our cars, and around the world. It's probably something you should be aware of and begin understanding how to interact with, as ai will become a big part of our lives soon.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Great product,"Great product, just wish the speaker was a little louder. Other than that it’s awesome and look forward to getting more",4.0 out of 5 stars

Get an Echo!!,We have fun asking it all sorts of things,5.0 out of 5 stars
Fun and useful product,"We love the music, the games, the stories, the jokes, the calling feature, the audio books, the fact-checking.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Works great with smart plugs and lights,"I got my Alexa when I bought a 4 pack of LIFX wireless smart bulbs, it was sorta a package deal. I also bought a 4 pack of Teckin smart plugs. I live in a dorm room, so I was afraid that the spotty school WiFi would cause my Alexa to frequently lose connection with my lights and other devices, but even with the school WiFi, it works great!
Easy to set up and easy to use. Makes a lazy guys life a whole lot easier when you can turn things on/off or change colors of lights by using your Alexa.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Will buy again,"We love our Echo Dots. We have two in the house now and are waiting for a sale to pick up a third. Easy to operate. Use the Alexa app to set daily alarms and my kids can operate them to hear jokes, check the forecast before getting dressed, set timers, and listen to Pandora radio.",5.0 out of 5 stars

never play one song complete,"it is not work, never play one song complete, I still need to play music from my Mac.",1.0 out of 5 stars
One of Amazon's lesser products,"Very tinny speakers Bought the 3 pack so they were only $25 each. If I paid $49 each I would be unhappy with the value compared to the regular Echo. Of the three, one gets very warm compared to the other 2. These are extras for additional rooms, maybe should have waited for a good markdown sale on the Echo. Overall: Not Impressed.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Cheap, but you get less than you pay for","I have the original echo and a dot. The original works great but the dot doesn't work consistently, maybe 50/50. Perhaps the wireless receiver isn't strong enough...not sure, but it seems to drop out easily...giving the orange circle of death. I've reset the thing three times. Still no long term improvement.",2.0 out of 5 stars
The dot rocks,"Alexa is great. So easy to use. Music, alarm, info....etc.",5.0 out of 5 stars
We use Google home more.,We don't use it as much as we thought we would. We have Google home in our house and we use that much more than Alexa,3.0 out of 5 stars

The first step to Home Automation.,"Cool little device. Answer all my questions, great alarm clock and a lot more.

Home Assistant (aka: My BFF!!!),"Finally bought one to try. I love Alexa! So easy to set up and use. Besides easily checking the weather, or a word definition, you can set specific reminders and also access your electronic phone calendars.
Daunted by the silence, I say “Alexa, tell me a joke“. The silence is now laughter (or at least giggles). Thanks for the smile Alexa!
Laying in bed at night, can’t fall asleep… “Alexa, tell me a bedtime story...”
I have since bought one more for myself, and two more for my friends.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Pretty cool technology,"Pretty cool technology. Voice recognition not always great though as Alexa does misinterpret my voice at times. She doesn't control my Fire tv well either. All in all, still worth the price especially once I add other smart devices to my home.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Echo dot,Just as described,5.0 out of 5 stars
Better than Google Home,"I like this product very much and have found that it is much more functional than Google Home. My only real complaint is the ""smart"" devices they try to bundle it with. In our case it was a Kasa Smart Wi-Fi Plug by TP-Link. That product worked fairly well for approximately three months and then stopped abruptly. I have followed the recommended troubleshooting steps and have even deleted the device from the app and reinstalled it. No luck. Conveniently (for Kasa), it is not accepting reviews for that product, so I cannot voice my displeasure with that product directly.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Love them in our home!,"I received an Echo for Christmas last year, we fell in love with it and decided to buy one for the kids to be able to set their own alarms and listen to their own music :)",5.0 out of 5 stars
The Echo Dot is entertaining,What fun!,5.0 out of 5 stars
Disappointed,"It does have work well, my Echo Dot does nothing close to what is advertised. I am pretty disappointed and won’t buy another Echo again",1.0 out of 5 stars
Set-up is a challenge,"I give it a 3-star due to set up problems. Although the process looks simple, I had to run through it more than several times before it actually set up. The problem was not at my end. There is a bit of a learning curve in getting on board with Alexa. I asked some simple questions and she is clueless. Amazon sends emails with suggested questions. I'm not into popular culture so most of the questions are useless for me. At least, she knows the outside temperature and humidity.",3.0 out of 5 stars
This is a POS!,This is a POS! It skips music and pauses frequently. I would not buy again!,1.0 out of 5 stars

Easy to set up,"I love this product for listening to my music, I sync it with my iTunes while cleaning my house. Also it’s great for appointment reminders. However I recommend hooking it up to a speaker as the music from the device itself is not very loud. But overall I am happy with my echo dot.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Oh Alexa..... is there anything u can't do??,"I love it! This little gadget is my favorite thing in my home, it's absolutely thee most helpful piece of technology anyone can have plugged in at home. If u need a weather update, just ask Alexa. If u want to hear your favorite song, just ask Alexa. If u want your lights turned on or off hands free, just ask Alexa. If u need a recipe, just ask Alexa. If u want to make a phone call, just ask Alexa to make the call. Alarm clock, timers, reminders, placing an order on Amazon... yeah, she does that too. Oh, did I mention, she tells jokes too?? AMAZon / AMAZing.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Better than Google Home Mini,"Alexa has numerous capabilities that do not require the personal information invasiveness of Google Home mini (received as gift). Have it linked to my Amazon Music Unlimited account and can play my dad’s playlist or favorite artists anytime he needs it. I love the game skills, the corny jokes of the day, and that it can access my favorite religious website and read the Bible or play music located there.",5.0 out of 5 stars
She can do it! Just say it.,"Great product, very useful. It’s important that I keep track of my many activities during the day as a single mother who is working full time, so being able to say “Alexa, set a reminder” is wonderful.

Echo dot 5 star,Love it,5.0 out of 5 stars
Wanting specific music? Must purchase an additional membership to Amazon Music...$$$$$,"I like being able to say “Echo, start my day” and it tells me about the news, weather and commute. I can make lunches, coffee and get my morning going without having to wait for the info on the TV. That’s a great function and it’s handsfree. I don’t like that the music is very limited even though I have Amazon Prime, that’s very irritating. Every time I ask it to play a song, it says that is not available due to “No membership to amazon music!” I almost feel like I should have bought an Apple speaker.
I do enjoy the reminders and alarms that i am able to set for my kids though, that is a great feature.",3.0 out of 5 stars
It really is an awesome tool.,"I love my Echo Dot! I initially bought this for my kids to help with school really things like, spelling and research. However we use it for so much more music, alarms, timers, recipes pretty much everything. I now have 4 in my home I'm very impressed by all the things echo can do. I would definitely recommend to everyone. 😁",5.0 out of 5 stars

Fun and easy,The kids are enjoying Alexa,5.0 out of 5 stars
Useless for music.,"I bought this for the sole purpose of being able to say “Alexa play whatever song” it failed completely to play the song I wanted to play via my Pandora account, it kept telling me it could play it via a Amazon Music account, so I subscribed to Amazon Music. But nope, the same song it said it could play via their music service failed 100% of the time, I have NEVER been more frustrated by a piece of “smart” technology... it’s freaking retarded. Everything I wanted to accomplish with this piece of shit can be accomplished though my phone. Complete 100% waste of money.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Great with a few ""Skills"" that you like","""Alexa, add comet to my shopping list."" ""Alexa, what is the weather today?"" ""Alexa, what temperature should chicken be cooked to?"" ""Alexa, set my bedroom light to 10%."" I feel like I am using Star Trek technology with this thing. If I run out of something I can immediately add it to my shopping list with a quick command. I can also quickly figure out what type of coat I should run out of the house with in the morning when I haven't had my coffee yet. My hands are all covered with chicken residue and I forget what temperature chicken should be cooked to? No problem, Alexa knows.
The only thing holding Alexa back is that it uses the Bing search engine and will not be able to answer everything. I really wish you can swap it to Google (you probably can somehow like with a skill but am not currently aware). The voice reception also isn't the greatest thing ever invented, but it is good enough. I need to raise my voice with a somewhat loud AC running, which I think is fair and shouldn't be a major gripe. A normal person in the room probably wouldn't be able to hear me mumbling something with the AC running either. This thing is so cheap for what it does. The only person who is not impressed by what I can do with it is my cat. He's very hard to impress though.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"Just ok. Typical answer is ""I don't know that one""","The Dot device works fine. No problem connecting or communicating but the answers given are lacking any detail. The ""knowledge"" of Alexa is not the best. Way too many ""I don't know the answer to that"" answers. And the answers that are given are so short that you are left feeling like there was no answer at all. It would be nice to have the answer expanded upon and more information on the subject given. Also it would be better for to continue questioning on the current topic to get a clearer answer. Instead, it is necessary to change the way you ask questions to get the answer you were trying to get to in the first palce. Works great as a timer, for trivia type questions, the weather and to play songs but other than that just eh.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Liking the features.,I've had my Echo Dot for about a month now. I like the size as it doesn't stand out like a sore thumb on my table. The sound is great and it seems to understand very well when asked a questions. I never thought I wanted or needed on but got it as a package deal with something else I purchased which made this really cheap and couldn't resist what all the fuss was about. Since I have had it my kids have loved asking questions and jokes. My husbands loves that he can get the weather when getting ready for work without have to turn on the TV or scrolling his phone. He travels for work so he can get all the weather he needs in a matter of seconds. I like the reminder feature as I can be forgetful. I also like that I can be busy and tell it to call someone from my contact and it does and I can talk and continue doing what i'm doing. All out I would have to say I'm glad I made the decision to purchase this.,5.0 out of 5 stars

Does what its supposed to mostly,I bought this with the Echo thinking that Id need this In my bedroom since the bigger echo was in my den. When I'm in my room asking Alexa to do something my other device in the den picks up as well.

Pro's and Con's,"ECHO makes checking the forecast a snap. I like how I can ask it to play random songs. I also enjoy the ""skills"" that facillitate saying the rosary while I work in the kitchen. It's like Siri on steroids.
Unfotunately, one must almost yell in order for ECHO to hear requests. Also, I have started music playlists but ECHO fails to recognize the names--I have even double checked the app to make sure I'm calling them by the correct name. When I checked the app, I learned that the I had the correct list names but that the songs were deleted. Also, it is a little sad that I have now increased my use of technology...when one may be better off enjoying the silence that leads to greater peace and true joy.",4.0 out of 5 stars

tried to love it but not easy,"I purchased the device while it was on Christmas promotion to work with several home automation devices (smart switch) that I have in house.
The to-be-loved part are the installation is easy; fun to play with; and worked as promised. The to-be-hated part is 50% of time it failed to work as promised.. main reasons include network disconnection for no reason, Alexa failed to recognize the comments, and Alexa just decided not to work. And all of these happened few weeks after retiring period was over.
I had a live chat with Amazon technician tried to resolve the to-be-hated items; and I might got into the technician at a wrong time as not only nothing was resolved but also was treated pretty rude. I felt the technician might have a believe how great the product should be and how could I had such issues to be questioned.
In short.. issues still exist and Echo Dot does not seem to be fixed nor allow to reset.
So still 50% love and 50% hate; compared to 80% love and 20% hate on my Google Home.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Very fun and novel item to have!,I got the Echo Dot bundles with the Amazon Firestick for an amazing deal during Prime Day! I mainly used the Echo Dot to set an alarm for the following morning or have her tell me what the weather is like. You’ll have some fun interactions with it. Speakers are absolutely terrible so don’t buy it for listening to music. I’m working one ‘smartifying’ my home so will be looking to purchase a few more in the future. Possibly an Echo or Echo Plus for better speakers.,4.0 out of 5 stars

"Will NOT reconnect to wifi hot spot to use in car, confirmed by Amazon","I bought this specifically to use in my car. It connects to my phone hotspot when I go through the entire setup process and works fine. It WILL NOT reconnect to the same hotspot, same phone, same network name after I disconnect and come back to my car. I don't see why this is difficult to do. I called Amazon and they said the solution is to go through the setup process every time and it will work fine. RIDICULOUS. I might as well plan to get in my car 10 minutes early every time so I can hook up Alexa. And add 10 minutes every time I get gas or stop and shut off my car. Seems simple. Amazon makes it difficult.",1.0 out of 5 stars

My first experience with an Assistant,"Works as promised. Voice recognition almost flawless. I don't remember a single misunderstood command. I don't use it much... Just weather, music, local alerts. Connected easily to my big Bluetooth speaker and the music quality is better than the small echo. Alexa is a great randomizer for casual music. Sometimes I don't know exactly what I want to hear... Alexa does a good job of playing random selections for a particular style that are interesting.
Maybe it will become more useful in the future... the music alone is worth the cost.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Awesome echo at awesome price,I have an existing sound bar and want an echo extension in my room. Echo dot works perfectly after integrating it with my existing sound bar.

Good for simple tasks,"I use my Echo Dot/Alexa on a daily basis, and for simple tasks, it/she works wonderfully. Requests and questions such as ""start a 5 minute timer,"" ""read news from NPR,"" and ""what is 753 divided by 4?"" all work work just fine.
But I cannot count the number of times that Alexa has misheard me (I make an effort to speak loudly, slowly, and clearly). She does NOT work well with Spotify. And lastly, with tasks or requests that are less routine and more complex, by far the most common response is ""sorry, I don't know that one.""
The Echo Dot has amazing reviews, but I honestly believe that it is because this is a new technology, and people are enamored with its novelty. In 5 or 10 years, we are going to look back and realize that Alexa was (at least at the time of this review, 2018) glitchy and limited.",2.0 out of 5 stars

I have to yell at it,"I wanted to wait for a month or two before submitting this review. I felt that I needed to acquaint myself with the device before submitting an accurate review but the problems are worrisome and I doubt that they will be addressed until, hopefully the generation model #3 is available. I have had the device for a month now.
The first problem I have is that the device demands a very accurate speech pattern before you can get what you are seeking. An example: I tried three different methods to get an audiobook I had been listening to just the night before.
I have to raise my voice substantially before the device will respond.
It doesn't always listen to what you are saying before it goes off on another selection that you don't want. This happens regularly with music.
It goes off-line if there is break in the electrical connection, no battery backup.
A battery back-up would be nice when you want to listen to music and don't have an outlet handy. I like to listen when I am soaking in the tub. The speakers are weak on the dots so it's not always pleasurable.
The positive aspects of the device are the ease of handling. I like to keep my shopping list up to date. I don't forget things anymore because the device keeps track for me. This is invaluable to me.
If and when I can get it to read my audiobooks, it's a pleasure.
I like listening to the news and getting exactly what I want to listen to without wading through everything else.
The sleep sounds are very nice.
The support techs are great and always there when I have a problem. They are always patient and supportive and I am always satisfied with their service.

Not phenominal,"I like the accessibility. I don't like the selectiveness since it is everything amazon. I can only play music from my amazon music and spotify accounts. Even more, this echo dot HAS to be plugged in to work, which is a waste of time and energy. I have to unplug it when I'm leaving from home, and then it takes a minute or so to load when replugged. Also, it's not a speaker per say, therefore I have to connect to another speaker if I want volume and bass when playing music. It's cool for setting and sticking to any agenda while being hands free. But my phone is in my hand all the time so it hasn't added much to my daily routine.",3.0 out of 5 stars

The Amazon Tap has a fantastic speaker and is portable. We have used it outside for great sounding music. The only disadvantage with the Tap is that it is not hands free. You have to push a button to activate it. The Echo Dot is hands free and I love that, but the speaker is not that powerful to hear music like the Tap. That's why we have both devices. The Echo Dot is a hands free wonderful effortless source of on the ""dot"" source of information. I would highly recommend both of these devices for a full range of uses.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Good- When she hears me!,"I've had this thing for about 6 months now and she doesn't listen. I haven't bothered leaving a review because it hasn't made me this mad until this morning. Usually, I don't have to repeat myself more than 10 times, and if it does take me that many times, I give up because whatever I want isn't that important. Well, I've started using her for my alarm in the mornings. I should have known better. Like I said, I usually don't have to repeat myself more than 10x. This morning at 6 AM, I was not a happy camper. I was repeating ""Alexa Stop,"" increasing my volume until actually shouting, then lowering my voice to see if that would make her listen, then raising it again out of frustration and just to see if she's FREAKING DEAF rinse repeat for a solid 5 minutes until I remembered there are buttons on the top of the device, and I scrambled over and pressed them all and she finally stopped.
Remember this is 6 AM. If I had been more awake, I would have unplugged it or pressed the button sooner instead of shouting forever.
Also, she is not too far away from me or obstructed in any way. She is only about 6 feet away from me and there is nothing above or in front of her at all. There is a picture frame behind her, but that's it.
When she works, she works fine. I have tolerated it up to this point because I don't really use it and I don't care that much. It was a gift, which is the only reason I use it, but this morning I was so angry, I would have broken it if it wouldn't have taken so much energy. I hate it. This gadget is not worth it.
It's got rave reviews from thousands of other people, though, so maybe I've got a lemon or it is worth it to other people.

Enjoying the echo.,"We bought the Echo Dot along with a docking station with an alarm clock (with battery backup) a few days after we bought our Exho Show for the kitchen (amazing if you like to cook-recipes, measurements and conversions, timer, entertainment). We love both. We have not had them long and are not utilizing all of their capabilities yet. However, so far we are impressed.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Content restricted to amazon only, not sure it’s worth it.","Good for playing music but Alexa lacks skills of google home as content is restricted to only amazons network, can’t play African songs or ask generic questions and get the right answers. Would not buy again . Might actually return it for a google home.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Great for music!,I love this for my daughter. She has it connected to a soundbar and plays music from Amazon music. We use it almost like an intercom system since we have several throughout the house. I wish that each echo could be in more than one multi room music group though.,4.0 out of 5 stars

Awesome,"Originally, I purchased only one of these. After playing around with it for about a week, I went back and purchased two more. I love these things. They’re like having a personal assistant, music DJ, game show host, storyteller, personal shopper, etc. etc. etc. all rolled into one. I primarily use these to play music from my Amazon Prime Unlimited and various other accounts. But it also gets used to remind me about appointments, as a timer for food that I am cooking and as a means to make my grocery shopping list. I also use it for weather reports; commute times, to send messages to family and friends, to order things off of Amazon, to wake me up in the morning and just as a source for general trivia. It changes the channels for my DirecTV, it gives me a news briefing every morning while I'm getting ready for work and it even knows jokes (not very good ones but it tries). I’m going to start purchasing the smart home devices (light switches, wall plugs and a thermostat) and see how they work with Alexa soon. I love that once I have those installed I can simply walk into my bedroom and say, “Alexa, goodnight” and my lights around the house will all turn off, the front and back doors will lock, the ceiling fan above my bed will come on, and my music will begin to play over the blue tooth speakers at a soft volume thus allowing me to drift off to sleep. Then when it’s time to get up, Alexa lets me know by blasting Reveille from my speakers, starts my coffee maker, turns on the bedroom light, turns off the ceiling fan and gives me my morning news briefing. I ask about my schedule for the day and what my commute into work looks like and she lets me know both what I have scheduled and whether I should take an alternate route into work due to traffic concerns.
The ONLY negative I have found thus far is that as I walk around the house and notice that I need to add multiple items to my shopping list, I must individually give separate commands to each and every item to be added to list… i.e. if I need paper towels, bacon and toothpaste I must say, “Alexa add paper towels to the shopping list.” “Alexa add bacon to the shopping list.” “Alexa add toothpaste to the shopping list.” Instead of just saying, “Alexa add paper towels and bacon and toothpaste to the shopping list.” Anyway, it’s minor and certainly not a deal breaker. Perhaps as they continually update the software this will be one of the things that they improve upon.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Great for music,"Great for listening to music via voice command. I have it hooked up through my stereo system and the sound quality is excellent, it struggles to hear my commands when the music is on loud, but otherwise does fantastic.

Sad it’s not wireless.,"The Echo Dot is fine for listening to quiet music in my kitchen. I was disappointed to realize that it is not a wireless device (which makes sense when you realize the marketing suggests putting them all over your house).

Good for what it is,"This device is NOT a music-centered speaker. This is for home automation and voice command stuff (shopping lists, lights on and off, weather forecast, stocks, etc). If you want a device to jam to, use the Echo or the Tap or connect a speaker to the Dot. It has all the functionality of an Echo/Tap/whatever, but the speaker quality is not very high, and the volume also doesn't go very high. It's entry-level; basic.",3.0 out of 5 stars
SO useful!,"These are amazing! I went shopping for one to put in my little girl’s room to use as an intercom for waking her in the morning without waking her baby siblings, calling everyone for dinner, etc. I ended up getting 3 of them and put them throughout the house! Not only is it excellent as an intercom, I can “drop in” to the dot in the house even when away from home using the app!

IMPORTANT PANDORA ADVICE: if you say ""Alexa, play Pandora"" she will ask you ""What do you want to hear."" - basically asking for a station you have on Pandora.

Don’t expect your music subscription to transfer to a second device.,The Dot is fine. My complaint is that Amazon music wants me to pay for another subscription with a different device .

most useless electronic device in my house,"We've had two of these Amazon dots since Christmas. They are the most useless electronic devices in my house and that includes any that are broken. I can ask it simple questions such as when did Andre Agassi play his last tennis game and the answer that I get out of 99% of what I ask is ""hmmm I don't know that"". If I have to keep ability of looking it up online then this stupid Amazon thing should be doing the exact same thing. I asked today to multiply $2.59 by 3 and it was unable to do it. (""hmmm I don't know that"" is all i get) This device is so frustrating. It might be useful if you've got a ""smart house"" with all your devices and lights wired into your network but just as a general use to do other things it's useless. I can set a timer with my watch or my phone or even an old fashioned twist timer I don't need this electronic device to do it for me. I used to be able to set a reminder that would go every 30 days to remind me to change my air conditioning filter. They have done some sort of update and now I cannot do that reminder I can only do a reminder on weekdays weekends go figure or weekly I cannot tell it to remind me every 30 days or every 90 days or every two weeks or three weeks. With each and every update they do the device is more and more useless if that's even possible. Oh it will tell me what the weather is......big deal. I can look it up online myself.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Echo dots are great additions to our Echo family,"I bought two echo dots while they were on sail. I am not tech illiterate but am not super savvy either. I found the dots easy to set up and use. I learned very quickly not to put an echo dot two close to the Echo because everyone talks at once. It was really interesting when I asked my kindle to bring up my books, the dot said I should check out prime books and the Echo started reading the book I was part way through. If it wasn't so funny it probably would have been irritating. The dots have been separated from both each other and the main Echo and work great. It is definitely nice to have Alexa around the house, although I don't have a smart house, for updates, music and someone who actually answers me. The only limitation I have found thus far is the dots, even with external speakers attached, don't increase volume very much. The dot twins were easy to manage so I'm sure it won't be long until we increase the size of the Echo family once again.",5.0 out of 5 stars

It must be within 15 feet of your router,"I read all of your info about the Echo Dot. No where did it state that it must be within 15 feet of your router. So my Echo Dot was attached to my bedroom lamp which is 30 feet away. It dropped WiFi connection daily.
I was instructed when I called Amazon to contact my WiFi provider to get mgh strength, make a change on my router settings and or buy a WiFi booster.
Your sales pitch is you plug it in and connect to WiFi and voila! it works. Well it didn’t and I wish I had more info before I purchased it.

Beware,"I loved my echo dot— until it died.
There was no way to repair it, according to customer service, so now my only option is to buy a new one. That really ticks me off since it isn’t even a year old! It’s a rip-off to have to pay for a second one (at a price higher than I paid for the first one) for it to only work eight months. That really ticks me off. I mean- it isn’t even a year old! So, for me, It’s a rip-off. Anyway, take it for what it’s worth. I guess nothing is well-made these days.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Awesome for keeping our household on track!,We now have 4 echo dots. What an amazing device!! So much fun exploring the various functions and uses. I love putting reminders on my kids dots with my phone app. We remind them of their reoccurring chores at different dates & times. We also have Alexa tell them their parents are proud of them at bedtime. Yes we tell them in person but out tech savvy teens get a kick out of Alexa reminding them.,5.0 out of 5 stars

"Dot setup fail with Google Pixel (1st gen) Android 9 and Alexa app (plus an ""everywhere"" solution)","I went to add 3 more Dots to my house to finally give us full house multiroom music. The first Dot refused to get past trying to connect to my wireless. The Dot would announce that it was connected and to finish the setup in the Alexa app, but then the Alexa app would never get off the screen trying to connect to Dot/wireless. I finally changed phones and voila it worked the first time. Seems the Pixel on Android 9 couldn't cooperate with the Dot. I changed to my Moto G5 Plus with Android 7 and it just worked. The key seemed to be the Moto/Android 7 would immediately say to manually connect the wifi to the Dot. The Pixel/Android 9 would never suggest connecting manually and even when I did it manually it would connect to the Dot and then nothing would happen and then sometimes it would jump back to the normal wifi network. With the Moto/Android 7 it just worked and then I quickly set up the other two dots.
I also have three wireless access points (APs) and if the Dot's/Echo's are not all on the same AP then there is a good chance they will not all play on the ""everywhere"" group. Since Amazon won't let me forget a network that an Echo/Dot discovered, I had to rename two of my APs with names that the Echo/Dot didn't know. This way they always connect to the one AP and I no longer get a random collection of Dots/Echos playing around the house ... along with an annoyed wife.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Echo Dot,"I found the Echo Dot fairly easy to set up and use. However, I intended to set up the Echo Dot using the Libratone speaker ""Scene"". I was unable to set up the Libratone ""Scene"" with Echo Dot using WIFI. The only way I was able to use the Libratone speaker was through bluetooth. I also found using Amazon music and SirusXM to lag/skip when the music is played through the Echo Dot. I also use Apple Siri with Homepod. Although, Siri is very limited with its applications compared to Amazon Alexa, I have Siri with Homepod less complicated and more predictable to use.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Works great with my old stereo as a way to play cloud music,I like this device my son told me I was going to hate it he told me to get a different version by a competitor I decided for the $24 that it was on sale I would give it a shot what I found was it works perfectly for what I needed I have an old stereo and I like to listen to music I have been using Spotify and Amazon Music I wasn’t sure if the echo would support Spotify or Amazon music without a subscriptionI was pleasantly surprised that it supports both I didn’t actually set up Spotify so it still might require a subscription but the Amazon music work with just a normal prime account here and I now no longer have to get up to change song skip songs if it shows up by phone what’s playing and I can skip there also,5.0 out of 5 stars
Great...at first,"I've had my echo dot just shy of 2 years. My whole family loved it at first but it seems that after every update it gets significantly worse. She no longer learns from my requests. We have a lamp set up with a Wemo plugin that allows us to control the lamp functions with the echo. I have the lamp named ""lamp"" on both the echo and the wemo app. When I tell Alexa to turn lamp on, 75% of the time she hears me saying the word light instead of lamp. I get that the first letter is the same and there are the same amount of syllables but it's so different sounding. Then when the room is absolutely quiet, I will request Alexa to do something and she doesn't hear me. I can be within a single foot and she still won't hear me. If there was background noise, I would understand, but there isn't. There are other times when I will ask Alexa to set an alarm or to start a timer and she will but it will mysteriously cancel somewhere in the middle, which is highly inconvenient. Needless to say, I won't be buying any additional echos. I'm trying to figure out how to get rid of the 3 I already own.",2.0 out of 5 stars

It wakes me every morning and it doesn't annoy me with a blaring beeping noise every morning like old style clocks. She is great with a quick timer. She leaves something to be desired when it comes to reminders but there are skills for that I am investigating. She's quick with basic math problems. Her basic weather reports are decent and accurate as long as you put in your address. Her question answering skills are basic at best but I'm sure she will grow as Amazon continues to grow her AI database.

"Long on promises, short on delivery","As one who purchased Amazon Echo / Alexa as soon as it was available to the general public, I had high hopes. Knowing that it was a new use of existing technology, I was patient with Amazon as it worked to iron out the wrinkles on the way to fulfilling its promise that this cloud-connected device would constantly be improving. I even bought Echo Dots and Echo Dots (2nd Generation). However, Amazon chose to focus more on adding advanced features than on perfecting the basic features. So, Echo can do many things poorly and nothing well. It fails to understand basic commands and often even stops listening halfway through input. It plays songs fine when it's able to find them but even that is hit and miss if two bands have similar names or if Alexa has no idea how the band names are pronounced (for instance, it used to call Sugarland ""Sir Garland."")

The Ultimate Product,"This product family ""Echo"" and Amazon have done a superb job of creating a product that performs one task and does it exceptionally well. The MMI (Man Machine Interface) portion of technology is by far the most difficult and challenging. Background functions of communicating and interfacing to ""hardware"" follow strict rules (collaborative standards) and has been done well in the industry for years. Partnering with (skills) provides the marketing and functionality demarcation point to allow various industries to focus on what they do best. The one suggestion that would make this the ultimate product is to create a ""Echo Dot Decko"" with a Google Skill.

Do NOT get Sengled,"I got the echo dot plus sengled hub for my daughter. The dot works okay. The sengled hub and bulbs are a complete nightmare. It's been a week and I'm pulling my entire router out of the nether reaches of my closet--again-- to connect a very short ethernet cable to it and then to the singled hub because it keeps disconnecting. Even when it is working I can't get alexa to turn off the lights, we have to name them one by one. ""Alexa, turn off bulb 1. Alexa, turn off bulb 2. Alexa, turn off bulb three"" Alexa responds with "" Bulb 3 is not responding"" Ok. I could have flipped a switch on the wall ten minutes ago to get my damn lights off. NOT worth it. I know there is a way to get them all to go off and on with one request but the software isn't intuitive enough for me to figure it out. I don't want to spend hours trying to figure out how to get 'smart' bulbs to work. Oh, I also had to return a different sengled bulb because it wouldn't work with the sengled hub I purchased.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Spend more on echo (not dot) & get good sound,I have echo second generations in both bedrooms. The sound quality is amazing. I bought an echo dot for the kitchen because I thought the sound would be “not quite” as excellent but good—and the small size was preferable for the countertop. The cheaper price was really why I went with it tho. I was wrong to cut corners. There is no comparison between the sound of two devices. None. It’s the difference between Bose and an old handheld transistor radio.,3.0 out of 5 stars

What would we do without Alexa?,"This was my third Dot. We use them every day. My son loves setting his morning alarm with whatever song he thinks like will make him feel good when he wakes up. When I'm in the kitchen, I listen to my favorite radio station or my current Audible book, and love being able to set multiple named timers as I cook. The grandkids get a kick out of asking Alexa what time it is or what day of the week it is, and she tells great knock-knock jokes. Then there's the Drop-In function, which we used like a baby monitor when Mom was sick, and it's much better than yelling upstairs when dinner is ready. I'm always learning new ways to use my Dots through blogs and Pinterest. It's hard to imagine life without Alexa!",5.0 out of 5 stars

It works... somewhat.,"I really like that I can control my smart home gadgets by voice. Cool. I realize we are still beta testing because Alexa is in the rough, but with plenty of potiential. If you have a really clear, loud, and robotic voice then you’re good. But if you’re in the southeast (me) and have the slightest southern dialect, (me) getting Alexa to turn the living room light off (example) can become a real challenge requiring multiple attempts and time wasted. Smart home technology should ease effort. Alexa isn’t quite there yet. I’m sure I could do several things to improve my Alexa experience, like re-word my preset commands to something Alexa couldn’t mistake. For example I could change the voice command from “Alexa, turn the lights down” to “Alexa, purple banana” and the voice recognition would be able to differentiate the command better from similar commands that sound alike. This is really my only complaint. More of a constructive criticism than a complaint really because I really like the product. Price is great, product is cool and good quality with a nice fit and finish. But need to improve voice recognition. Since Alexa is so popular, we often hear advertisements via tv or radio that will “wake” Alexa and the software will respond randomly. (Funny at first, annoying several hundred times later) It should learn my voice, and other household users to better understand who is giving commands. And FYI, I might be a southerner, but love that West coast vibe! But I still want to control my Alexa, even in the southeast! Haha :) We will be there soon, just not there yet.",3.0 out of 5 stars
